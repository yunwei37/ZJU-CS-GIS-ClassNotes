 Enter PARIS, TROILUS, AENEAS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR, and DIOMEDES  PARIS  It is great morning, and the hour prefix'd 
 Of her delivery to this valiant Greek 
 Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus, 
 Tell you the lady what she is to do, 
 And haste her to the purpose. 
 TROILUS  Walk into her house; 
 I'll bring her to the Grecian presently: 
 And to his hand when I deliver her, 
 Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus 
 A priest there offering to it his own heart. 

 Exit  PARIS  I know what 'tis to love; 
 And would, as I shall pity, I could help! 
 Please you walk in, my lords.
