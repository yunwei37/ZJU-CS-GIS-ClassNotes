 Enter ISABELLA and MARIANA  ISABELLA  To speak so indirectly I am loath: 
 I would say the truth; but to accuse him so, 
 That is your part: yet I am advised to do it; 
 He says, to veil full purpose. 
 MARIANA  Be ruled by him. 
 ISABELLA  Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure 
 He speak against me on the adverse side, 
 I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic 
 That's bitter to sweet end. 
 MARIANA  I would Friar Peter-- 
 ISABELLA  O, peace! the friar is come. 

 Enter FRIAR PETER  FRIAR PETER  Come, I have found you out a stand most fit, 
 Where you may have such vantage on the duke, 
 He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded; 
 The generous and gravest citizens 
 Have hent the gates, and very near upon 
 The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!
