 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE III. The woods. Timon's cave, and a rude tomb seen. 
 Enter a Soldier, seeking TIMON  Soldier  By all description this should be the place. 
 Who's here? speak, ho! No answer! What is this? 
 Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span: 
 Some beast rear'd this; there does not live a man. 
 Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb 
 I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax: 
 Our captain hath in every figure skill, 
 An aged interpreter, though young in days: 
 Before proud Athens he's set down by this, 
 Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.
