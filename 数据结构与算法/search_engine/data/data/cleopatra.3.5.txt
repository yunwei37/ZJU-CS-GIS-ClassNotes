 Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and EROS, meeting  DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  How now, friend Eros! 
 EROS  There's strange news come, sir. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  What, man? 
 EROS  Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  This is old: what is the success? 
 EROS  Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst 
 Pompey, presently denied him rivality; would not let 
 him partake in the glory of the action: and not 
 resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly 
 wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so 
 the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more; 
 And throw between them all the food thou hast, 
 They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony? 
 EROS  He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns 
 The rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool Lepidus!' 
 And threats the throat of that his officer 
 That murder'd Pompey. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  Our great navy's rigg'd. 
 EROS  For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius; 
 My lord desires you presently: my news 
 I might have told hereafter. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  'Twill be naught: 
 But let it be. Bring me to Antony. 
 EROS  Come, sir.
