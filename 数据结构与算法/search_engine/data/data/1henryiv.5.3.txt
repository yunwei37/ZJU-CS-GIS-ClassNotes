 KING HENRY enters with his power. Alarum to the battle. Then enter DOUGLAS and SIR WALTER BLUNT  SIR WALTER BLUNT  What is thy name, that in the battle thus 
 Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek 
 Upon my head? 
 EARL OF DOUGLAS  Know then, my name is Douglas; 
 And I do haunt thee in the battle thus 
 Because some tell me that thou art a king. 
 SIR WALTER BLUNT  They tell thee true. 
 EARL OF DOUGLAS  The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought 
 Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry, 
 This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee, 
 Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner. 
 SIR WALTER BLUNT  I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot; 
 And thou shalt find a king that will revenge 
 Lord Stafford's death. 

 They fight. DOUGLAS kills SIR WALTER BLUNT. Enter HOTSPUR  HOTSPUR  O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus, 
 never had triumph'd upon a Scot. 
 EARL OF DOUGLAS  All's done, all's won; here breathless lies the king. 
 HOTSPUR  Where? 
 EARL OF DOUGLAS  Here. 
 HOTSPUR  This, Douglas? no: I know this face full well: 
 A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt; 
 Semblably furnish'd like the king himself. 
 EARL OF DOUGLAS  A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes! 
 A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear: 
 Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king? 
 HOTSPUR  The king hath many marching in his coats. 
 EARL OF DOUGLAS  Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats; 
 I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece, 
 Until I meet the king. 
 HOTSPUR  Up, and away! 
 Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day. 

 Exeunt 
 Alarum. Enter FALSTAFF, solus  FALSTAFF  Though I could 'scape shot-free at London, I fear 
 the shot here; here's no scoring but upon the pate. 
 Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour 
 for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten 
 lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I 
 need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have 
 led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's 
 not three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and 
 they are for the town's end, to beg during life. 
 But who comes here? 

 Enter PRINCE HENRY  PRINCE HENRY  What, stand'st thou idle here? lend me thy sword: 
 Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff 
 Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies, 
 Whose deaths are yet unrevenged: I prithee, 
 lend me thy sword. 
 FALSTAFF  O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile. 
 Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have 
 done this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure. 
 PRINCE HENRY  He is, indeed; and living to kill thee. I prithee, 
 lend me thy sword. 
 FALSTAFF  Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st 
 not my sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt. 
 PRINCE HENRY  Give it to me: what, is it in the case? 
 FALSTAFF  Ay, Hal; 'tis hot, 'tis hot; there's that will sack a city. 

 PRINCE HENRY draws it out, and finds it to be a bottle of sack  PRINCE HENRY  What, is it a time to jest and dally now? 

 He throws the bottle at him. Exit  FALSTAFF  Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do 
 come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his 
 willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like 
 not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give me 
 life: which if I can save, so; if not, honour comes 
 unlooked for, and there's an end.
