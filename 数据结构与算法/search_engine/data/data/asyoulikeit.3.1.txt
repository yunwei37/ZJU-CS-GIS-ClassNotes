 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE I. A room in the palace. 
 Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, and OLIVER  DUKE FREDERICK  Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be: 
 But were I not the better part made mercy, 
 I should not seek an absent argument 
 Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it: 
 Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is; 
 Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living 
 Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more 
 To seek a living in our territory. 
 Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine 
 Worth seizure do we seize into our hands, 
 Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth 
 Of what we think against thee. 
 OLIVER  O that your highness knew my heart in this! 
 I never loved my brother in my life. 
 DUKE FREDERICK  More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors; 
 And let my officers of such a nature 
 Make an extent upon his house and lands: 
 Do this expediently and turn him going.
