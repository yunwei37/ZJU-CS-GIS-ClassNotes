 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE I. Florence. The DUKE's palace. 
 Flourish. Enter the DUKE of Florence attended; the two Frenchmen, with a troop of soldiers.  DUKE  So that from point to point now have you heard 
 The fundamental reasons of this war, 
 Whose great decision hath much blood let forth 
 And more thirsts after. 
 First Lord  Holy seems the quarrel 
 Upon your grace's part; black and fearful 
 On the opposer. 
 DUKE  Therefore we marvel much our cousin France 
 Would in so just a business shut his bosom 
 Against our borrowing prayers. 
 Second Lord  Good my lord, 
 The reasons of our state I cannot yield, 
 But like a common and an outward man, 
 That the great figure of a council frames 
 By self-unable motion: therefore dare not 
 Say what I think of it, since I have found 
 Myself in my incertain grounds to fail 
 As often as I guess'd. 
 DUKE  Be it his pleasure. 
 First Lord  But I am sure the younger of our nature, 
 That surfeit on their ease, will day by day 
 Come here for physic. 
 DUKE  Welcome shall they be; 
 And all the honours that can fly from us 
 Shall on them settle. You know your places well; 
 When better fall, for your avails they fell: 
 To-morrow to the field.
