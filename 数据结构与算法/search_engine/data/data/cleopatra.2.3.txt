 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE III. The same. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house. 
 Enter MARK ANTONY, OCTAVIUS CAESAR, OCTAVIA between them, and Attendants  MARK ANTONY  The world and my great office will sometimes 
 Divide me from your bosom. 
 OCTAVIA  All which time 
 Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers 
 To them for you. 
 MARK ANTONY  Good night, sir. My Octavia, 
 Read not my blemishes in the world's report: 
 I have not kept my square; but that to come 
 Shall all be done by the rule. Good night, dear lady. 
 Good night, sir. 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  Good night. 

 Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and OCTAVIA 
 Enter Soothsayer  MARK ANTONY  Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt? 
 Soothsayer  Would I had never come from thence, nor you Thither! 
 MARK ANTONY  If you can, your reason? 
 Soothsayer  I see it in 
 My motion, have it not in my tongue: but yet 
 Hie you to Egypt again. 
 MARK ANTONY  Say to me, 
 Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine? 
 Soothsayer  Caesar's. 
 Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side: 
 Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, is 
 Noble, courageous high, unmatchable, 
 Where Caesar's is not; but, near him, thy angel 
 Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd: therefore 
 Make space enough between you. 
 MARK ANTONY  Speak this no more. 
 Soothsayer  To none but thee; no more, but when to thee. 
 If thou dost play with him at any game, 
 Thou art sure to lose; and, of that natural luck, 
 He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens, 
 When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit 
 Is all afraid to govern thee near him; 
 But, he away, 'tis noble. 
 MARK ANTONY  Get thee gone: 
 Say to Ventidius I would speak with him: 

 Exit Soothsayer  He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap, 
 He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him; 
 And in our sports my better cunning faints 
 Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds; 
 His cocks do win the battle still of mine, 
 When it is all to nought; and his quails ever 
 Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt: 
 And though I make this marriage for my peace, 
 I' the east my pleasure lies. 

 Enter VENTIDIUS  O, come, Ventidius, 
 You must to Parthia: your commission's ready; 
 Follow me, and receive't.
