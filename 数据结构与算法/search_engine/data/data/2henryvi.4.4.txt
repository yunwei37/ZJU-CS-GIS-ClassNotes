 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE IV. London. The palace. 
 Enter KING HENRY VI with a supplication, and the QUEEN with SUFFOLK'S head, BUCKINGHAM and Lord SAY  QUEEN MARGARET  Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind, 
 And makes it fearful and degenerate; 
 Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep. 
 But who can cease to weep and look on this? 
 Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast: 
 But where's the body that I should embrace? 
 BUCKINGHAM  What answer makes your grace to the rebels' 
 supplication? 
 KING HENRY VI  I'll send some holy bishop to entreat; 
 For God forbid so many simple souls 
 Should perish by the sword! And I myself, 
 Rather than bloody war shall cut them short, 
 Will parley with Jack Cade their general: 
 But stay, I'll read it over once again. 
 QUEEN MARGARET  Ah, barbarous villains! hath this lovely face 
 Ruled, like a wandering planet, over me, 
 And could it not enforce them to relent, 
 That were unworthy to behold the same? 
 KING HENRY VI  Lord Say, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head. 
 SAY  Ay, but I hope your highness shall have his. 
 KING HENRY VI  How now, madam! 
 Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk's death? 
 I fear me, love, if that I had been dead, 
 Thou wouldst not have mourn'd so much for me. 
 QUEEN MARGARET  No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee. 

 Enter a Messenger  KING HENRY VI  How now! what news? why comest thou in such haste? 
 Messenger  The rebels are in Southwark; fly, my lord! 
 Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer, 
 Descended from the Duke of Clarence' house, 
 And calls your grace usurper openly 
 And vows to crown himself in Westminster. 
 His army is a ragged multitude 
 Of hinds and peasants, rude and merciless: 
 Sir Humphrey Stafford and h is brother's death 
 Hath given them heart and courage to proceed: 
 All scholars, lawyers, courtiers, gentlemen, 
 They call false caterpillars, and intend their death. 
 KING HENRY VI  O graceless men! they know not what they do. 
 BUCKINGHAM  My gracious lord, return to Killingworth, 
 Until a power be raised to put them down. 
 QUEEN MARGARET  Ah, were the Duke of Suffolk now alive, 
 These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased! 
 KING HENRY VI  Lord Say, the traitors hate thee; 
 Therefore away with us to Killingworth. 
 SAY  So might your grace's person be in danger. 
 The sight of me is odious in their eyes; 
 And therefore in this city will I stay 
 And live alone as secret as I may. 

 Enter another Messenger  Messenger  Jack Cade hath gotten London bridge: 
 The citizens fly and forsake their houses: 
 The rascal people, thirsting after prey, 
 Join with the traitor, and they jointly swear 
 To spoil the city and your royal court. 
 BUCKINGHAM  Then linger not, my lord, away, take horse. 
 KING HENRY VI  Come, Margaret; God, our hope, will succor us. 
 QUEEN MARGARET  My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceased. 
 KING HENRY VI  Farewell, my lord: trust not the Kentish rebels. 
 BUCKINGHAM  Trust nobody, for fear you be betray'd. 
 SAY  The trust I have is in mine innocence, 
 And therefore am I bold and resolute.
