 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE V. A park near Middleham Castle In Yorkshire. 
 Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and STANLEY  GLOUCESTER  Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley, 
 Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither, 
 Into this chiefest thicket of the park. 
 Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother, 
 Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands 
 He hath good usage and great liberty, 
 And, often but attended with weak guard, 
 Comes hunting this way to disport himself. 
 I have advertised him by secret means 
 That if about this hour he make his way 
 Under the colour of his usual game, 
 He shall here find his friends with horse and men 
 To set him free from his captivity. 

 Enter KING EDWARD IV and a Huntsman with him  Huntsman  This way, my lord; for this way lies the game. 
 KING EDWARD IV  Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand. 
 Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest, 
 Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer? 
 GLOUCESTER  Brother, the time and case requireth haste: 
 Your horse stands ready at the park-corner. 
 KING EDWARD IV  But whither shall we then? 
 HASTINGS  To Lynn, my lord, 
 And ship from thence to Flanders. 
 GLOUCESTER  Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning. 
 KING EDWARD IV  Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness. 
 GLOUCESTER  But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk. 
 KING EDWARD IV  Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along? 
 Huntsman  Better do so than tarry and be hang'd. 
 GLOUCESTER  Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado. 
 KING EDWARD IV  Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown; 
 And pray that I may repossess the crown.
