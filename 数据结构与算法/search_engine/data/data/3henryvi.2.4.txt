 Excursions. Enter RICHARD and CLIFFORD  RICHARD  Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone: 
 Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York, 
 And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge, 
 Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall. 
 CLIFFORD  Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone: 
 This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York; 
 And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland; 
 And here's the heart that triumphs in their death 
 And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother 
 To execute the like upon thyself; 
 And so, have at thee! 

 They fight. WARWICK comes; CLIFFORD flies  RICHARD  Nay Warwick, single out some other chase; 
 For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.
