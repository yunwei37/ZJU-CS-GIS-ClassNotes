 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE VI. The same. 
 Enter, on the walls, JOAN LA PUCELLE, CHARLES, REIGNIER, ALENCON, and Soldiers  JOAN LA PUCELLE  Advance our waving colours on the walls; 
 Rescued is Orleans from the English 
 Thus Joan la Pucelle hath perform'd her word. 
 CHARLES  Divinest creature, Astraea's daughter, 
 How shall I honour thee for this success? 
 Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens 
 That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next. 
 France, triumph in thy glorious prophetess! 
 Recover'd is the town of Orleans: 
 More blessed hap did ne'er befall our state. 
 REIGNIER  Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town? 
 Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires 
 And feast and banquet in the open streets, 
 To celebrate the joy that God hath given us. 
 ALENCON  All France will be replete with mirth and joy, 
 When they shall hear how we have play'd the men. 
 CHARLES  'Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won; 
 For which I will divide my crown with her, 
 And all the priests and friars in my realm 
 Shall in procession sing her endless praise. 
 A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear 
 Than Rhodope's or Memphis' ever was: 
 In memory of her when she is dead, 
 Her ashes, in an urn more precious 
 Than the rich-jewel'd of Darius, 
 Transported shall be at high festivals 
 Before the kings and queens of France. 
 No longer on Saint Denis will we cry, 
 But Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint. 
 Come in, and let us banquet royally, 
 After this golden day of victory.
