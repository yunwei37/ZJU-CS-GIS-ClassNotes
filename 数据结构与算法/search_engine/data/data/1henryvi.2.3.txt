 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE III. Auvergne. The COUNTESS's castle. 
 Enter the COUNTESS and her Porter  COUNTESS 
 OF AUVERGNE  Porter, remember what I gave in charge; 
 And when you have done so, bring the keys to me. 
 Porter  Madam, I will. 

 Exit  COUNTESS 
 OF AUVERGNE  The plot is laid: if all things fall out right, 
 I shall as famous be by this exploit 
 As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death. 
 Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight, 
 And his achievements of no less account: 
 Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears, 
 To give their censure of these rare reports. 

 Enter Messenger and TALBOT  Messenger  Madam, 
 According as your ladyship desired, 
 By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come. 
 COUNTESS 
 OF AUVERGNE  And he is welcome. What! is this the man? 
 Messenger  Madam, it is. 
 COUNTESS 
 OF AUVERGNE  Is this the scourge of France? 
 Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad 
 That with his name the mothers still their babes? 
 I see report is fabulous and false: 
 I thought I should have seen some Hercules, 
 A second Hector, for his grim aspect, 
 And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs. 
 Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf! 
 It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp 
 Should strike such terror to his enemies. 
 TALBOT  Madam, I have been bold to trouble you; 
 But since your ladyship is not at leisure, 
 I'll sort some other time to visit you. 
 COUNTESS 
 OF AUVERGNE  What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes. 
 Messenger  Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves 
 To know the cause of your abrupt departure. 
 TALBOT  Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief, 
 I go to certify her Talbot's here. 

 Re-enter Porter with keys  COUNTESS 
 OF AUVERGNE  If thou be he, then art thou prisoner. 
 TALBOT  Prisoner! to whom? 
 COUNTESS 
 OF AUVERGNE  To me, blood-thirsty lord; 
 And for that cause I trained thee to my house. 
 Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me, 
 For in my gallery thy picture hangs: 
 But now the substance shall endure the like, 
 And I will chain these legs and arms of thine, 
 That hast by tyranny these many years 
 Wasted our country, slain our citizens 
 And sent our sons and husbands captivate. 
 TALBOT  Ha, ha, ha! 
 COUNTESS 
 OF AUVERGNE  Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan. 
 TALBOT  I laugh to see your ladyship so fond 
 To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow 
 Whereon to practise your severity. 
 COUNTESS 
 OF AUVERGNE  Why, art not thou the man? 
 TALBOT  I am indeed. 
 COUNTESS 
 OF AUVERGNE  Then have I substance too. 
 TALBOT  No, no, I am but shadow of myself: 
 You are deceived, my substance is not here; 
 For what you see is but the smallest part 
 And least proportion of humanity: 
 I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here, 
 It is of such a spacious lofty pitch, 
 Your roof were not sufficient to contain't. 
 COUNTESS 
 OF AUVERGNE  This is a riddling merchant for the nonce; 
 He will be here, and yet he is not here: 
 How can these contrarieties agree? 
 TALBOT  That will I show you presently. 

 Winds his horn. Drums strike up: a peal of ordnance. Enter soldiers  How say you, madam? are you now persuaded 
 That Talbot is but shadow of himself? 
 These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength, 
 With which he yoketh your rebellious necks, 
 Razeth your cities and subverts your towns 
 And in a moment makes them desolate. 
 COUNTESS 
 OF AUVERGNE  Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse: 
 I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited 
 And more than may be gather'd by thy shape. 
 Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath; 
 For I am sorry that with reverence 
 I did not entertain thee as thou art. 
 TALBOT  Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconstrue 
 The mind of Talbot, as you did mistake 
 The outward composition of his body. 
 What you have done hath not offended me; 
 Nor other satisfaction do I crave, 
 But only, with your patience, that we may 
 Taste of your wine and see what cates you have; 
 For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well. 
 COUNTESS 
 OF AUVERGNE  With all my heart, and think me honoured 
 To feast so great a warrior in my house.
