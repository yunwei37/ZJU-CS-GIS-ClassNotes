 Enter THURIO, PROTEUS, and JULIA  THURIO  Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit? 
 PROTEUS  O, sir, I find her milder than she was; 
 And yet she takes exceptions at your person. 
 THURIO  What, that my leg is too long? 
 PROTEUS  No; that it is too little. 
 THURIO  I'll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder. 
 JULIA  [Aside]  But love will not be spurr'd to what 
 it loathes. 
 THURIO  What says she to my face? 
 PROTEUS  She says it is a fair one. 
 THURIO  Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black. 
 PROTEUS  But pearls are fair; and the old saying is, 
 Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes. 
 JULIA  [Aside]  'Tis true; such pearls as put out 
 ladies' eyes; 
 For I had rather wink than look on them. 
 THURIO  How likes she my discourse? 
 PROTEUS  Ill, when you talk of war. 
 THURIO  But well, when I discourse of love and peace? 
 JULIA  [Aside]  But better, indeed, when you hold your peace. 
 THURIO  What says she to my valour? 
 PROTEUS  O, sir, she makes no doubt of that. 
 JULIA  [Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice. 
 THURIO  What says she to my birth? 
 PROTEUS  That you are well derived. 
 JULIA  [Aside]  True; from a gentleman to a fool. 
 THURIO  Considers she my possessions? 
 PROTEUS  O, ay; and pities them. 
 THURIO  Wherefore? 
 JULIA  [Aside]  That such an ass should owe them. 
 PROTEUS  That they are out by lease. 
 JULIA  Here comes the duke. 

 Enter DUKE  DUKE  How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio! 
 Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late? 
 THURIO  Not I. 
 PROTEUS  Nor I. 
 DUKE  Saw you my daughter? 
 PROTEUS  Neither. 
 DUKE  Why then, 
 She's fled unto that peasant Valentine; 
 And Eglamour is in her company. 
 'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both, 
 As he in penance wander'd through the forest; 
 Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she, 
 But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it; 
 Besides, she did intend confession 
 At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not; 
 These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence. 
 Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse, 
 But mount you presently and meet with me 
 Upon the rising of the mountain-foot 
 That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled: 
 Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me. 

 Exit  THURIO  Why, this it is to be a peevish girl, 
 That flies her fortune when it follows her. 
 I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour 
 Than for the love of reckless Silvia. 

 Exit  PROTEUS  And I will follow, more for Silvia's love 
 Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her. 

 Exit  JULIA  And I will follow, more to cross that love 
 Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.
