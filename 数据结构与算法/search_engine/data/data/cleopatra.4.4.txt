 Enter MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and others attending  MARK ANTONY  Eros! mine armour, Eros! 
 CLEOPATRA  Sleep a little. 
 MARK ANTONY  No, my chuck. Eros, come; mine armour, Eros! 

 Enter EROS with armour  Come good fellow, put mine iron on: 
 If fortune be not ours to-day, it is 
 Because we brave her: come. 
 CLEOPATRA  Nay, I'll help too. 
 What's this for? 
 MARK ANTONY  Ah, let be, let be! thou art 
 The armourer of my heart: false, false; this, this. 
 CLEOPATRA  Sooth, la, I'll help: thus it must be. 
 MARK ANTONY  Well, well; 
 We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow? 
 Go put on thy defences. 
 EROS  Briefly, sir. 
 CLEOPATRA  Is not this buckled well? 
 MARK ANTONY  Rarely, rarely: 
 He that unbuckles this, till we do please 
 To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm. 
 Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire 
 More tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love, 
 That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st 
 The royal occupation! thou shouldst see 
 A workman in't. 

 Enter an armed Soldier  Good morrow to thee; welcome: 
 Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge: 
 To business that we love we rise betime, 
 And go to't with delight. 
 Soldier  A thousand, sir, 
 Early though't be, have on their riveted trim, 
 And at the port expect you. 

 Shout. Trumpets flourish 
 Enter Captains and Soldiers  Captain  The morn is fair. Good morrow, general. 
 All  Good morrow, general. 
 MARK ANTONY  'Tis well blown, lads: 
 This morning, like the spirit of a youth 
 That means to be of note, begins betimes. 
 So, so; come, give me that: this way; well said. 
 Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me: 
 This is a soldier's kiss: rebukeable 

 Kisses her  And worthy shameful cheque it were, to stand 
 On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee 
 Now, like a man of steel. You that will fight, 
 Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu. 

 Exeunt MARK ANTONY, EROS, Captains, and Soldiers  CHARMIAN  Please you, retire to your chamber. 
 CLEOPATRA  Lead me. 
 He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might 
 Determine this great war in single fight! 
 Then Antony,--but now--Well, on.
