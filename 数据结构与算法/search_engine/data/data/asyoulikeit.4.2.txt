 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE II. The forest. 
 Enter JAQUES, Lords, and Foresters  JAQUES  Which is he that killed the deer? 
 A Lord  Sir, it was I. 
 JAQUES  Let's present him to the duke, like a Roman 
 conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's 
 horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have 
 you no song, forester, for this purpose? 
 Forester  Yes, sir. 
 JAQUES  Sing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it 
 make noise enough. 
 SONG. 
 Forester  What shall he have that kill'd the deer? 
 His leather skin and horns to wear. 
 Then sing him home; 

 The rest shall bear this burden  Take thou no scorn to wear the horn; 
 It was a crest ere thou wast born: 
 Thy father's father wore it, 
 And thy father bore it: 
 The horn, the horn, the lusty horn 
 Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.
