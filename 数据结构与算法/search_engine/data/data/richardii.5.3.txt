 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE III. A royal palace. 
 Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE, HENRY PERCY, and other Lords  HENRY BOLINGBROKE  Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son? 
 'Tis full three months since I did see him last; 
 If any plague hang over us, 'tis he. 
 I would to God, my lords, he might be found: 
 Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there, 
 For there, they say, he daily doth frequent, 
 With unrestrained loose companions, 
 Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes, 
 And beat our watch, and rob our passengers; 
 Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy, 
 Takes on the point of honour to support 
 So dissolute a crew. 
 HENRY PERCY  My lord, some two days since I saw the prince, 
 And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford. 
 HENRY BOLINGBROKE  And what said the gallant? 
 HENRY PERCY  His answer was, he would unto the stews, 
 And from the common'st creature pluck a glove, 
 And wear it as a favour; and with that 
 He would unhorse the lustiest challenger. 
 HENRY BOLINGBROKE  As dissolute as desperate; yet through both 
 I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years 
 May happily bring forth. But who comes here? 

 Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE  DUKE OF AUMERLE  Where is the king? 
 HENRY BOLINGBROKE  What means our cousin, that he stares and looks 
 So wildly? 
 DUKE OF AUMERLE  God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty, 
 To have some conference with your grace alone. 
 HENRY BOLINGBROKE  Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone. 

 Exeunt HENRY PERCY and Lords  What is the matter with our cousin now? 
 DUKE OF AUMERLE  For ever may my knees grow to the earth, 
 My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth 
 Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak. 
 HENRY BOLINGBROKE  Intended or committed was this fault? 
 If on the first, how heinous e'er it be, 
 To win thy after-love I pardon thee. 
 DUKE OF AUMERLE  Then give me leave that I may turn the key, 
 That no man enter till my tale be done. 
 HENRY BOLINGBROKE  Have thy desire. 
 DUKE OF YORK  [Within]  My liege, beware; look to thyself; 
 Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there. 
 HENRY BOLINGBROKE  Villain, I'll make thee safe. 

 Drawing  DUKE OF AUMERLE  Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear. 
 DUKE OF YORK  [Within]  Open the door, secure, foolhardy king: 
 Shall I for love speak treason to thy face? 
 Open the door, or I will break it open. 

 Enter DUKE OF YORK  HENRY BOLINGBROKE  What is the matter, uncle? speak; 
 Recover breath; tell us how near is danger, 
 That we may arm us to encounter it. 
 DUKE OF YORK  Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know 
 The treason that my haste forbids me show. 
 DUKE OF AUMERLE  Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd: 
 I do repent me; read not my name there 
 My heart is not confederate with my hand. 
 DUKE OF YORK  It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down. 
 I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king; 
 Fear, and not love, begets his penitence: 
 Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove 
 A serpent that will sting thee to the heart. 
 HENRY BOLINGBROKE  O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy! 
 O loyal father of a treacherous son! 
 Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain, 
 From when this stream through muddy passages 
 Hath held his current and defiled himself! 
 Thy overflow of good converts to bad, 
 And thy abundant goodness shall excuse 
 This deadly blot in thy digressing son. 
 DUKE OF YORK  So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd; 
 And he shall spend mine honour with his shame, 
 As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold. 
 Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies, 
 Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies: 
 Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath, 
 The traitor lives, the true man's put to death. 
 DUCHESS OF YORK  [Within]  What ho, my liege! for God's sake, 
 let me in. 
 HENRY BOLINGBROKE  What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry? 
 DUCHESS OF YORK  A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I. 
 Speak with me, pity me, open the door. 
 A beggar begs that never begg'd before. 
 HENRY BOLINGBROKE  Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing, 
 And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.' 
 My dangerous cousin, let your mother in: 
 I know she is come to pray for your foul sin. 
 DUKE OF YORK  If thou do pardon, whosoever pray, 
 More sins for this forgiveness prosper may. 
 This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound; 
 This let alone will all the rest confound. 

 Enter DUCHESS OF YORK  DUCHESS OF YORK  O king, believe not this hard-hearted man! 
 Love loving not itself none other can. 
 DUKE OF YORK  Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here? 
 Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear? 
 DUCHESS OF YORK  Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege. 

 Kneels  HENRY BOLINGBROKE  Rise up, good aunt. 
 DUCHESS OF YORK  Not yet, I thee beseech: 
 For ever will I walk upon my knees, 
 And never see day that the happy sees, 
 Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy, 
 By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy. 
 DUKE OF AUMERLE  Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee. 
 DUKE OF YORK  Against them both my true joints bended be. 
 Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace! 
 DUCHESS OF YORK  Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face; 
 His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest; 
 His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast: 
 He prays but faintly and would be denied; 
 We pray with heart and soul and all beside: 
 His weary joints would gladly rise, I know; 
 Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow: 
 His prayers are full of false hypocrisy; 
 Ours of true zeal and deep integrity. 
 Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have 
 That mercy which true prayer ought to have. 
 HENRY BOLINGBROKE  Good aunt, stand up. 
 DUCHESS OF YORK  Nay, do not say, 'stand up;' 
 Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.' 
 And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach, 
 'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech. 
 I never long'd to hear a word till now; 
 Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how: 
 The word is short, but not so short as sweet; 
 No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet. 
 DUKE OF YORK  Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.' 
 DUCHESS OF YORK  Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy? 
 Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord, 
 That set'st the word itself against the word! 
 Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land; 
 The chopping French we do not understand. 
 Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there; 
 Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear; 
 That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce, 
 Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse. 
 HENRY BOLINGBROKE  Good aunt, stand up. 
 DUCHESS OF YORK  I do not sue to stand; 
 Pardon is all the suit I have in hand. 
 HENRY BOLINGBROKE  I pardon him, as God shall pardon me. 
 DUCHESS OF YORK  O happy vantage of a kneeling knee! 
 Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again; 
 Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain, 
 But makes one pardon strong. 
 HENRY BOLINGBROKE  With all my heart 
 I pardon him. 
 DUCHESS OF YORK  A god on earth thou art. 
 HENRY BOLINGBROKE  But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot, 
 With all the rest of that consorted crew, 
 Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels. 
 Good uncle, help to order several powers 
 To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are: 
 They shall not live within this world, I swear, 
 But I will have them, if I once know where. 
 Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu: 
 Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true. 
 DUCHESS OF YORK  Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new.
