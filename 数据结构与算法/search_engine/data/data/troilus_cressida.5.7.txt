 Enter ACHILLES, with Myrmidons  ACHILLES  Come here about me, you my Myrmidons; 
 Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel: 
 Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath: 
 And when I have the bloody Hector found, 
 Empale him with your weapons round about; 
 In fellest manner execute your aims. 
 Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye: 
 It is decreed Hector the great must die. 

 Exeunt 
 Enter MENELAUS and PARIS, fighting: then THERSITES  THERSITES  The cuckold and the cuckold-maker are at it. Now, 
 bull! now, dog! 'Loo, Paris, 'loo! now my double- 
 henned sparrow! 'loo, Paris, 'loo! The bull has the 
 game: ware horns, ho! 

 Exeunt PARIS and MENELAUS 
 Enter MARGARELON  MARGARELON  Turn, slave, and fight. 
 THERSITES  What art thou? 
 MARGARELON  A bastard son of Priam's. 
 THERSITES  I am a bastard too; I love bastards: I am a bastard 
 begot, bastard instructed, bastard in mind, bastard 
 in valour, in every thing illegitimate. One bear will 
 not bite another, and wherefore should one bastard? 
 Take heed, the quarrel's most ominous to us: if the 
 son of a whore fight for a whore, he tempts judgment: 
 farewell, bastard. 

 Exit  MARGARELON  The devil take thee, coward!
