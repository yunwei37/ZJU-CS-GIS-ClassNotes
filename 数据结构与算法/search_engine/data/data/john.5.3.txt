 Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick! 

 Enter a Messenger  Messenger  My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge, 
 Desires your majesty to leave the field 
 And send him word by me which way you go. 
 KING JOHN  Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.

 KING JOHN  Ay me! this tyrant fever burns me up, 
 And will not let me welcome this good news. 
 Set on toward Swinstead: to my litter straight; 
 Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.
