 Nurse  They call for dates and quinces in the pastry. 

 Enter CAPULET  CAPULET  Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd, 
 The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock: 
 Look to the baked meats, good Angelica: 
 Spare not for the cost. 
 Nurse  Go, you cot-quean, go, 
 Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow 
 For this night's watching. 
 CAPULET  No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now 
 All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick. 
 LADY CAPULET  Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time; 
 But I will watch you from such watching now.

 First Servant  Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what. 
 CAPULET  Make haste, make haste. 

 Exit First Servant  Sirrah, fetch drier logs: 
 Call Peter, he will show thee where they are. 
 Second Servant  I have a head, sir, that will find out logs, 
 And never trouble Peter for the matter. 

 Exit  CAPULET  Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha! 
 Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day: 
 The county will be here with music straight, 
 For so he said he would: I hear him near. 

 Music within  Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say! 

 Re-enter Nurse  Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up; 
 I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste, 
 Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already: 
 Make haste, I say.
