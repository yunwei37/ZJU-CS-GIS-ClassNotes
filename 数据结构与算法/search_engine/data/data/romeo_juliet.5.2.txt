 Enter FRIAR JOHN  FRIAR JOHN  Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho! 

 Enter FRIAR LAURENCE  FRIAR LAURENCE  This same should be the voice of Friar John. 
 Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo? 
 Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter. 
 FRIAR JOHN  Going to find a bare-foot brother out 
 One of our order, to associate me, 
 Here in this city visiting the sick, 
 And finding him, the searchers of the town, 
 Suspecting that we both were in a house 
 Where the infectious pestilence did reign, 
 Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth; 
 So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd. 
 FRIAR LAURENCE  Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo? 
 FRIAR JOHN  I could not send it,--here it is again,-- 
 Nor get a messenger to bring it thee, 
 So fearful were they of infection. 
 FRIAR LAURENCE  Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood, 
 The letter was not nice but full of charge 
 Of dear import, and the neglecting it 
 May do much danger. Friar John, go hence; 
 Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight 
 Unto my cell. 
 FRIAR JOHN  Brother, I'll go and bring it thee. 

 Exit  FRIAR LAURENCE  Now must I to the monument alone; 
 Within three hours will fair Juliet wake: 
 She will beshrew me much that Romeo 
 Hath had no notice of these accidents; 
 But I will write again to Mantua, 
 And keep her at my cell till Romeo come; 
 Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
