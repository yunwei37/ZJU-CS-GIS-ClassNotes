 Alarum. Enter fighting, Soldiers of both armies; then BRUTUS, CATO, LUCILIUS, and others  BRUTUS  Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads! 
 CATO  What bastard doth not? Who will go with me? 
 I will proclaim my name about the field: 
 I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho! 
 A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend; 
 I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho! 
 BRUTUS  And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I; 
 Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus! 

 Exit  LUCILIUS  O young and noble Cato, art thou down? 
 Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius; 
 And mayst be honour'd, being Cato's son. 
 First Soldier  Yield, or thou diest. 
 LUCILIUS  Only I yield to die: 
 There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight; 

 Offering money  Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death. 
 First Soldier  We must not. A noble prisoner! 
 Second Soldier  Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en. 
 First Soldier  I'll tell the news. Here comes the general. 

 Enter ANTONY  Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord. 
 ANTONY  Where is he? 
 LUCILIUS  Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough: 
 I dare assure thee that no enemy 
 Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus: 
 The gods defend him from so great a shame! 
 When you do find him, or alive or dead, 
 He will be found like Brutus, like himself. 
 ANTONY  This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you, 
 A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe; 
 Give him all kindness: I had rather have 
 Such men my friends than enemies. Go on, 
 And see whether Brutus be alive or dead; 
 And bring us word unto Octavius' tent 
 How every thing is chanced.
