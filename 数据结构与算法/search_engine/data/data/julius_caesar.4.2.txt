 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE II. Camp near Sardis. Before BRUTUS's tent. 
 Drum. Enter BRUTUS, LUCILIUS, LUCIUS, and Soldiers; TITINIUS and PINDARUS meeting them  BRUTUS  Stand, ho! 
 LUCILIUS  Give the word, ho! and stand. 
 BRUTUS  What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near? 
 LUCILIUS  He is at hand; and Pindarus is come 
 To do you salutation from his master. 
 BRUTUS  He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus, 
 In his own change, or by ill officers, 
 Hath given me some worthy cause to wish 
 Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand, 
 I shall be satisfied. 
 PINDARUS  I do not doubt 
 But that my noble master will appear 
 Such as he is, full of regard and honour. 
 BRUTUS  He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius; 
 How he received you, let me be resolved. 
 LUCILIUS  With courtesy and with respect enough; 
 But not with such familiar instances, 
 Nor with such free and friendly conference, 
 As he hath used of old. 
 BRUTUS  Thou hast described 
 A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius, 
 When love begins to sicken and decay, 
 It useth an enforced ceremony. 
 There are no tricks in plain and simple faith; 
 But hollow men, like horses hot at hand, 
 Make gallant show and promise of their mettle; 
 But when they should endure the bloody spur, 
 They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades, 
 Sink in the trial. Comes his army on? 
 LUCILIUS  They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd; 
 The greater part, the horse in general, 
 Are come with Cassius. 
 BRUTUS  Hark! he is arrived. 

 Low march within  March gently on to meet him. 

 Enter CASSIUS and his powers  CASSIUS  Stand, ho! 
 BRUTUS  Stand, ho! Speak the word along. 
 First Soldier  Stand! 
 Second Soldier  Stand! 
 Third Soldier  Stand! 
 CASSIUS  Most noble brother, you have done me wrong. 
 BRUTUS  Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies? 
 And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother? 
 CASSIUS  Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs; 
 And when you do them-- 
 BRUTUS  Cassius, be content. 
 Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well. 
 Before the eyes of both our armies here, 
 Which should perceive nothing but love from us, 
 Let us not wrangle: bid them move away; 
 Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs, 
 And I will give you audience. 
 CASSIUS  Pindarus, 
 Bid our commanders lead their charges off 
 A little from this ground. 
 BRUTUS  Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man 
 Come to our tent till we have done our conference. 
 Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.
