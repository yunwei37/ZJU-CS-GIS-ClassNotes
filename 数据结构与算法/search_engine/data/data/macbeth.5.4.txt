 Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD and YOUNG  SIWARD, MACDUFF, MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, ROSS, and Soldiers, marching  MALCOLM  Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand 
 That chambers will be safe. 
 MENTEITH  We doubt it nothing. 
 SIWARD  What wood is this before us? 
 MENTEITH  The wood of Birnam. 
 MALCOLM  Let every soldier hew him down a bough 
 And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow 
 The numbers of our host and make discovery 
 Err in report of us. 
 Soldiers  It shall be done. 
 SIWARD  We learn no other but the confident tyrant 
 Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure 
 Our setting down before 't. 
 MALCOLM  'Tis his main hope: 
 For where there is advantage to be given, 
 Both more and less have given him the revolt, 
 And none serve with him but constrained things 
 Whose hearts are absent too. 
 MACDUFF  Let our just censures 
 Attend the true event, and put we on 
 Industrious soldiership. 
 SIWARD  The time approaches 
 That will with due decision make us know 
 What we shall say we have and what we owe. 
 Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate, 
 But certain issue strokes must arbitrate: 
 Towards which advance the war.
