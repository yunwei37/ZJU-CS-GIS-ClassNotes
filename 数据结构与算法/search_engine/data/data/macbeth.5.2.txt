 Drum and colours. Enter MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, and Soldiers  MENTEITH  The English power is near, led on by Malcolm, 
 His uncle Siward and the good Macduff: 
 Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes 
 Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm 
 Excite the mortified man. 
 ANGUS  Near Birnam wood 
 Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming. 
 CAITHNESS  Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother? 
 LENNOX  For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file 
 Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son, 
 And many unrough youths that even now 
 Protest their first of manhood. 
 MENTEITH  What does the tyrant? 
 CAITHNESS  Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies: 
 Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him 
 Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain, 
 He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause 
 Within the belt of rule. 
 ANGUS  Now does he feel 
 His secret murders sticking on his hands; 
 Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach; 
 Those he commands move only in command, 
 Nothing in love: now does he feel his title 
 Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe 
 Upon a dwarfish thief. 
 MENTEITH  Who then shall blame 
 His pester'd senses to recoil and start, 
 When all that is within him does condemn 
 Itself for being there? 
 CAITHNESS  Well, march we on, 
 To give obedience where 'tis truly owed: 
 Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal, 
 And with him pour we in our country's purge 
 Each drop of us. 
 LENNOX  Or so much as it needs, 
 To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds. 
 Make we our march towards Birnam. 

 Exeunt, marching  Shakespeare homepage  |  Macbeth  | Act 5, Scene 2
