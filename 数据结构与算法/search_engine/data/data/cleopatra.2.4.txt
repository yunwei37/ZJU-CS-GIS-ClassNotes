 Enter LEPIDUS, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA  LEPIDUS  Trouble yourselves no further: pray you, hasten 
 Your generals after. 
 AGRIPPA  Sir, Mark Antony 
 Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow. 
 LEPIDUS  Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress, 
 Which will become you both, farewell. 
 MECAENAS  We shall, 
 As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount 
 Before you, Lepidus. 
 LEPIDUS  Your way is shorter; 
 My purposes do draw me much about: 
 You'll win two days upon me. 
 MECAENAS  AGRIPPA  Sir, good success! 
 LEPIDUS  Farewell.
