 Enter PORTIA and NERISSA  PORTIA  Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed 
 And let him sign it: we'll away to-night 
 And be a day before our husbands home: 
 This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo. 

 Enter GRATIANO  GRATIANO  Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en 
 My Lord Bassanio upon more advice 
 Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat 
 Your company at dinner. 
 PORTIA  That cannot be: 
 His ring I do accept most thankfully: 
 And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore, 
 I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house. 
 GRATIANO  That will I do. 
 NERISSA  Sir, I would speak with you. 

 Aside to PORTIA  I'll see if I can get my husband's ring, 
 Which I did make him swear to keep for ever. 
 PORTIA  [Aside to NERISSA]  Thou mayst, I warrant. 
 We shall have old swearing 
 That they did give the rings away to men; 
 But we'll outface them, and outswear them too. 

 Aloud  Away! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry. 
 NERISSA  Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
