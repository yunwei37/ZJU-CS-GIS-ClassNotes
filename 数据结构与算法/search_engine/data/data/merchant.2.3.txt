 Enter JESSICA and LAUNCELOT  JESSICA  I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so: 
 Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil, 
 Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness. 
 But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee: 
 And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see 
 Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest: 
 Give him this letter; do it secretly; 
 And so farewell: I would not have my father 
 See me in talk with thee. 
 LAUNCELOT  Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful 
 pagan, most sweet Jew! if a Christian did not play 
 the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But, 
 adieu: these foolish drops do something drown my 
 manly spirit: adieu. 
 JESSICA  Farewell, good Launcelot. 

 Exit Launcelot  Alack, what heinous sin is it in me 
 To be ashamed to be my father's child! 
 But though I am a daughter to his blood, 
 I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo, 
 If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife, 
 Become a Christian and thy loving wife.
