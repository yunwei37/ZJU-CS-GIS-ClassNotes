 Flourish. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, with DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, and others  OCTAVIUS CAESAR  Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight: 
 Our will is Antony be took alive; 
 Make it so known. 
 AGRIPPA  Caesar, I shall. 

 Exit  OCTAVIUS CAESAR  The time of universal peace is near: 
 Prove this a prosperous day, the three-nook'd world 
 Shall bear the olive freely. 

 Enter a Messenger  Messenger  Antony 
 Is come into the field. 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  Go charge Agrippa 
 Plant those that have revolted in the van, 
 That Antony may seem to spend his fury 
 Upon himself. 

 Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  Alexas did revolt; and went to Jewry on 
 Affairs of Antony; there did persuade 
 Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar, 
 And leave his master Antony: for this pains 
 Caesar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest 
 That fell away have entertainment, but 
 No honourable trust. I have done ill; 
 Of which I do accuse myself so sorely, 
 That I will joy no more. 

 Enter a Soldier of CAESAR's  Soldier  Enobarbus, Antony 
 Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with 
 His bounty overplus: the messenger 
 Came on my guard; and at thy tent is now 
 Unloading of his mules. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  I give it you. 
 Soldier  Mock not, Enobarbus. 
 I tell you true: best you safed the bringer 
 Out of the host; I must attend mine office, 
 Or would have done't myself. Your emperor 
 Continues still a Jove. 

 Exit  DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  I am alone the villain of the earth, 
 And feel I am so most. O Antony, 
 Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid 
 My better service, when my turpitude 
 Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart: 
 If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean 
 Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel. 
 I fight against thee! No: I will go seek 
 Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits 
 My latter part of life.
