 Enter EXTON and Servant  EXTON  Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake, 
 'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?' 
 Was it not so? 
 Servant  These were his very words. 
 EXTON  'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice, 
 And urged it twice together, did he not? 
 Servant  He did. 
 EXTON  And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me, 
 And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man' 
 That would divorce this terror from my heart;' 
 Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go: 
 I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe.
