 Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS QUICKLY  FALSTAFF  Prithee, no more prattling; go. I'll hold. This is 
 the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd 
 numbers. Away I go. They say there is divinity in 
 odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. Away! 
 MISTRESS QUICKLY  I'll provide you a chain; and I'll do what I can to 
 get you a pair of horns. 
 FALSTAFF  Away, I say; time wears: hold up your head, and mince. 

 Exit MISTRESS QUICKLY 
 Enter FORD  How now, Master Brook! Master Brook, the matter 
 will be known to-night, or never. Be you in the 
 Park about midnight, at Herne's oak, and you shall 
 see wonders. 
 FORD  Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me 
 you had appointed? 
 FALSTAFF  I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor 
 old man: but I came from her, Master Brook, like a 
 poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband, 
 hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him, 
 Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell 
 you: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a 
 woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear 
 not Goliath with a weaver's beam; because I know 
 also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along 
 with me: I'll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I 
 plucked geese, played truant and whipped top, I knew 
 not what 'twas to be beaten till lately. Follow 
 me: I'll tell you strange things of this knave 
 Ford, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I 
 will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow. 
 Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.
