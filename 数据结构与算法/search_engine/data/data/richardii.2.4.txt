 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE IV. A camp in Wales. 
 Enter EARL OF SALISBURY and a Welsh Captain  Captain  My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days, 
 And hardly kept our countrymen together, 
 And yet we hear no tidings from the king; 
 Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell. 
 EARL OF SALISBURY  Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman: 
 The king reposeth all his confidence in thee. 
 Captain  'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay. 
 The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd 
 And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven; 
 The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth 
 And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change; 
 Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap, 
 The one in fear to lose what they enjoy, 
 The other to enjoy by rage and war: 
 These signs forerun the death or fall of kings. 
 Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled, 
 As well assured Richard their king is dead. 

 Exit  EARL OF SALISBURY  Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind 
 I see thy glory like a shooting star 
 Fall to the base earth from the firmament. 
 Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west, 
 Witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest: 
 Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes, 
 And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.
