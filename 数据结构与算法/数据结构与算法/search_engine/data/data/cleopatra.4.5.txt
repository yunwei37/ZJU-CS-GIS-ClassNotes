 Trumpets sound. Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS; a Soldier meeting them  Soldier  The gods make this a happy day to Antony! 
 MARK ANTONY  Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd 
 To make me fight at land! 
 Soldier  Hadst thou done so, 
 The kings that have revolted, and the soldier 
 That has this morning left thee, would have still 
 Follow'd thy heels. 
 MARK ANTONY  Who's gone this morning? 
 Soldier  Who! 
 One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus, 
 He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp 
 Say 'I am none of thine.' 
 MARK ANTONY  What say'st thou? 
 Soldier  Sir, 
 He is with Caesar. 
 EROS  Sir, his chests and treasure 
 He has not with him. 
 MARK ANTONY  Is he gone? 
 Soldier  Most certain. 
 MARK ANTONY  Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it; 
 Detain no jot, I charge thee: write to him-- 
 I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings; 
 Say that I wish he never find more cause 
 To change a master. O, my fortunes have 
 Corrupted honest men! Dispatch.--Enobarbus!
