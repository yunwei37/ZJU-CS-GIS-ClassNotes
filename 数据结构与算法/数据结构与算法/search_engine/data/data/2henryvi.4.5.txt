 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE V. London. The Tower. 
 Enter SCALES upon the Tower, walking. Then enter two or three Citizens below  SCALES  How now! is Jack Cade slain? 
 First Citizen  No, my lord, nor likely to be slain; for they have 
 won the bridge, killing all those that withstand 
 them: the lord mayor craves aid of your honour from 
 the Tower, to defend the city from the rebels. 
 SCALES  Such aid as I can spare you shall command; 
 But I am troubled here with them myself; 
 The rebels have assay'd to win the Tower. 
 But get you to Smithfield, and gather head, 
 And thither I will send you Matthew Goffe; 
 Fight for your king, your country and your lives; 
 And so, farewell, for I must hence again.
