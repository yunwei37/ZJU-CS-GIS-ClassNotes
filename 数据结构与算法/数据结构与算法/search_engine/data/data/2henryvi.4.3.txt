 Alarums to the fight, wherein SIR HUMPHREY and WILLIAM STAFFORD are slain. Enter CADE and the rest  CADE  Where's Dick, the butcher of Ashford? 
 DICK  Here, sir. 
 CADE  They fell before thee like sheep and oxen, and thou 
 behavedst thyself as if thou hadst been in thine own 
 slaughter-house: therefore thus will I reward thee, 
 the Lent shall be as long again as it is; and thou 
 shalt have a licence to kill for a hundred lacking 
 one. 
 DICK  I desire no more. 
 CADE  And, to speak truth, thou deservest no less. This 
 monument of the victory will I bear; 

 Putting on SIR HUMPHREY'S brigandine  and the bodies shall be dragged at my horse' heels 
 till I do come to London, where we will have the 
 mayor's sword borne before us. 
 DICK  If we mean to thrive and do good, break open the 
 gaols and let out the prisoners. 
 CADE  Fear not that, I warrant thee. Come, let's march 
 towards London.
