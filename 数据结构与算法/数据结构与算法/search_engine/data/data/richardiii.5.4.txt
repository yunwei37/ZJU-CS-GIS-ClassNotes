 Alarum: excursions. Enter NORFOLK and forces fighting; to him CATESBY  CATESBY  Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue! 
 The king enacts more wonders than a man, 
 Daring an opposite to every danger: 
 His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights, 
 Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death. 
 Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost! 

 Alarums. Enter KING RICHARD III  KING RICHARD III  A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse! 
 CATESBY  Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse. 
 KING RICHARD III  Slave, I have set my life upon a cast, 
 And I will stand the hazard of the die: 
 I think there be six Richmonds in the field; 
 Five have I slain to-day instead of him. 
 A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
