 Enter AJAX  AJAX  Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head! 

 Enter DIOMEDES  DIOMEDES  Troilus, I say! where's Troilus? 
 AJAX  What wouldst thou? 
 DIOMEDES  I would correct him. 
 AJAX  Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office 
 Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! what, Troilus! 

 Enter TROILUS  TROILUS  O traitor Diomed! turn thy false face, thou traitor, 
 And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse! 
 DIOMEDES  Ha, art thou there? 
 AJAX  I'll fight with him alone: stand, Diomed. 
 DIOMEDES  He is my prize; I will not look upon. 
 TROILUS  Come, both you cogging Greeks; have at you both! 

 Exeunt, fighting 
 Enter HECTOR  HECTOR  Yea, Troilus? O, well fought, my youngest brother! 

 Enter ACHILLES  ACHILLES  Now do I see thee, ha! have at thee, Hector! 
 HECTOR  Pause, if thou wilt. 
 ACHILLES  I do disdain thy courtesy, proud Trojan: 
 Be happy that my arms are out of use: 
 My rest and negligence befriends thee now, 
 But thou anon shalt hear of me again; 
 Till when, go seek thy fortune. 

 Exit  HECTOR  Fare thee well: 
 I would have been much more a fresher man, 
 Had I expected thee. How now, my brother! 

 Re-enter TROILUS  TROILUS  Ajax hath ta'en AEneas: shall it be? 
 No, by the flame of yonder glorious heaven, 
 He shall not carry him: I'll be ta'en too, 
 Or bring him off: fate, hear me what I say! 
 I reck not though I end my life to-day. 

 Exit 
 Enter one in sumptuous armour  HECTOR  Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark: 
 No? wilt thou not? I like thy armour well; 
 I'll frush it and unlock the rivets all, 
 But I'll be master of it: wilt thou not, 
 beast, abide? 
 Why, then fly on, I'll hunt thee for thy hide.
