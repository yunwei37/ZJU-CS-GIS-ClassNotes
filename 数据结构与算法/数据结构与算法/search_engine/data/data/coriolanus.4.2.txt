 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE II. The same. A  street near the gate. 
 Enter SICINIUS, BRUTUS, and an AEdile  SICINIUS  Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further. 
 The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided 
 In his behalf. 
 BRUTUS  Now we have shown our power, 
 Let us seem humbler after it is done 
 Than when it was a-doing. 
 SICINIUS  Bid them home: 
 Say their great enemy is gone, and they 
 Stand in their ancient strength. 
 BRUTUS  Dismiss them home. 

 Exit AEdile  Here comes his mother. 
 SICINIUS  Let's not meet her. 
 BRUTUS  Why? 
 SICINIUS  They say she's mad. 
 BRUTUS  They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way. 

 Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and MENENIUS  VOLUMNIA  O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods 
 Requite your love! 
 MENENIUS  Peace, peace; be not so loud. 
 VOLUMNIA  If that I could for weeping, you should hear,-- 
 Nay, and you shall hear some. 

 To BRUTUS  Will you be gone? 
 VIRGILIA  [To SICINIUS]  You shall stay too: I would I had the power 
 To say so to my husband. 
 SICINIUS  Are  you mankind? 
 VOLUMNIA  Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool. 
 Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship 
 To banish him that struck more blows for Rome 
 Than thou hast spoken words? 
 SICINIUS  O blessed heavens! 
 VOLUMNIA  More noble blows than ever thou wise words; 
 And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go: 
 Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son 
 Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him, 
 His good sword in his hand. 
 SICINIUS  What then? 
 VIRGILIA  What then! 
 He'ld make an end of thy posterity. 
 VOLUMNIA  Bastards and all. 
 Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome! 
 MENENIUS  Come, come, peace. 
 SICINIUS  I would he had continued to his country 
 As he began, and not unknit himself 
 The noble knot he made. 
 BRUTUS  I would he had. 
 VOLUMNIA  'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble: 
 Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth 
 As I can of those mysteries which heaven 
 Will not have earth to know. 
 BRUTUS  Pray, let us go. 
 VOLUMNIA  Now, pray, sir, get you gone: 
 You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:-- 
 As far as doth the Capitol exceed 
 The meanest house in Rome, so far my son-- 
 This lady's husband here, this, do you see-- 
 Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all. 
 BRUTUS  Well, well, we'll leave you. 
 SICINIUS  Why stay we to be baited 
 With one that wants her wits? 
 VOLUMNIA  Take my prayers with you. 

 Exeunt Tribunes  I would the gods had nothing else to do 
 But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em 
 But once a-day, it would unclog my heart 
 Of what lies heavy to't. 
 MENENIUS  You have told them home; 
 And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me? 
 VOLUMNIA  Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself, 
 And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go: 
 Leave this faint puling and lament as I do, 
 In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come. 
 MENENIUS  Fie, fie, fie!
