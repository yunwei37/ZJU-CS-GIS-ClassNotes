 Enter Outlaws with SILVIA  First Outlaw  Come, come, 
 Be patient; we must bring you to our captain. 
 SILVIA  A thousand more mischances than this one 
 Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently. 
 Second Outlaw  Come, bring her away. 
 First Outlaw  Where is the gentleman that was with her? 
 Third Outlaw  Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us, 
 But Moyses and Valerius follow him. 
 Go thou with her to the west end of the wood; 
 There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled; 
 The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape. 
 First Outlaw  Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave: 
 Fear not; he bears an honourable mind, 
 And will not use a woman lawlessly. 
 SILVIA  O Valentine, this I endure for thee!
