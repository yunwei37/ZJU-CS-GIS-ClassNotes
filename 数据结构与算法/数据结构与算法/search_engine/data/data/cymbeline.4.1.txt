 Enter CLOTEN  CLOTEN  I am near to the place where they should meet, if 
 Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments 
 serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by 
 him that made the tailor, not be fit too? the 
 rather--saving reverence of the word--for 'tis said 
 a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must 
 play the workman. I dare speak it to myself--for it 
 is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer 
 in his own chamber--I mean, the lines of my body are 
 as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong, 
 not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the 
 advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike 
 conversant in general services, and more remarkable 
 in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant 
 thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is! 
 Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy 
 shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy 
 mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before 
 thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her 
 father; who may haply be a little angry for my so 
 rough usage; but my mother, having power of his 
 testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My 
 horse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sore 
 purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand! This is 
 the very description of their meeting-place; and 
 the fellow dares not deceive me.
