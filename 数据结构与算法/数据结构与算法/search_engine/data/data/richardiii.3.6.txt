 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE VI. The same. 
 Enter a Scrivener, with a paper in his hand  Scrivener  This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings; 
 Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd, 
 That it may be this day read over in Paul's. 
 And mark how well the sequel hangs together: 
 Eleven hours I spent to write it over, 
 For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me; 
 The precedent was full as long a-doing: 
 And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings, 
 Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty 
 Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross, 
 That seeth not this palpable device? 
 Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not? 
 Bad is the world; and all will come to nought, 
 When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.
