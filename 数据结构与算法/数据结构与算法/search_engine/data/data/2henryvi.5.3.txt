 Previous scene  SCENE III. Fields near St. Alban's. 
 Alarum. Retreat. Enter YORK, RICHARD, WARWICK, and Soldiers, with drum and colours  YORK  Of Salisbury, who can report of him, 
 That winter lion, who in rage forgets 
 Aged contusions and all brush of time, 
 And, like a gallant in the brow of youth, 
 Repairs him with occasion? This happy day 
 Is not itself, nor have we won one foot, 
 If Salisbury be lost. 
 RICHARD  My noble father, 
 Three times to-day I holp him to his horse, 
 Three times bestrid him; thrice I led him off, 
 Persuaded him from any further act: 
 But still, where danger was, still there I met him; 
 And like rich hangings in a homely house, 
 So was his will in his old feeble body. 
 But, noble as he is, look where he comes. 

 Enter SALISBURY  SALISBURY  Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought to-day; 
 By the mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard: 
 God knows how long it is I have to live; 
 And it hath pleased him that three times to-day 
 You have defended me from imminent death. 
 Well, lords, we have not got that which we have: 
 'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled, 
 Being opposites of such repairing nature. 
 YORK  I know our safety is to follow them; 
 For, as I hear, the king is fled to London, 
 To call a present court of parliament. 
 Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth. 
 What says Lord Warwick? shall we after them? 
 WARWICK  After them! nay, before them, if we can. 
 Now, by my faith, lords, 'twas a glorious day: 
 Saint Alban's battle won by famous York 
 Shall be eternized in all age to come. 
 Sound drums and trumpets, and to London all: 
 And more such days as these to us befall!
