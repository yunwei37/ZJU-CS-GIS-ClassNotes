Preface to Revised Edition
How to Win Friends and Influence People was first published in 1937
in an edition of only five thousand copies. Neither Dale Carnegie nor
the publishers, Simon and Schuster, anticipated more than this
modest sale. To their amazement, the book became an overnight
sensation, and edition after edition rolled off the presses to keep up
with the increasing public demand. Now to Win Friends and
InfEuence People took its place in publishing history as one of the
all-time international best-sellers. It touched a nerve and filled a
human need that was more than a faddish phenomenon of post-
Depression days, as evidenced by its continued and uninterrupted
sales into the eighties, almost half a century later.
Dale Carnegie used to say that it was easier to make a million dollars
than to put a phrase into the English language. How to Win Friends
and Influence People became such a phrase, quoted, paraphrased,
parodied, used in innumerable contexts from political cartoon to
novels. The book itself was translated into almost every known
written language. Each generation has discovered it anew and has
found it relevant.
Which brings us to the logical question: Why revise a book that has
proven and continues to prove its vigorous and universal appeal?
Why tamper with success?
To answer that, we must realize that Dale Carnegie himself was a
tireless reviser of his own work during his lifetime. How to Win
Friends and Influence People was written to be used as a textbook
for his courses in Effective Speaking and Human Relations and is still
used in those courses today. Until his death in 1955 he constantly
improved and revised the course itself to make it applicable to the
evolving needs of an every-growing public. No one was more
sensitive to the changing currents of present-day life than Dale
Carnegie. He constantly improved and refined his methods of
teaching; he updated his book on Effective Speaking several times.
Had he lived longer, he himself would have revised How to Win
Friends and Influence People to better reflect the changes that have
taken place in the world since the thirties.
Many of the names of prominent people in the book, well known at
the time of first publication, are no longer recognized by many of
today's readers. Certain examples and phrases seem as quaint and
dated in our social climate as those in a Victorian novel. The
important message and overall impact of the book is weakened to
that extent.
Our purpose, therefore, in this revision is to clarify and strengthen
the book for a modern reader without tampering with the content.
We have not "changed" How to Win Friends and Influence People
except to make a few excisions and add a few more contemporary
examples. The brash, breezy Carnegie style is intact-even the thirties
slang is still there. Dale Carnegie wrote as he spoke, in an intensively
exuberant, colloquial, conversational manner.
So his voice still speaks as forcefully as ever, in the book and in his
work. Thousands of people all over the world are being trained in
Carnegie courses in increasing numbers each year. And other
thousands are reading and studying How to Win Friends and
lnfluence People and being inspired to use its principles to better
their lives. To all of them, we offer this revision in the spirit of the
honing and polishing of a finely made tool.

How This Book Was Written-And Why
by
Dale Carnegie
During the first thirty-five years of the twentieth century, the
publishing houses of America printed more than a fifth of a million
different books. Most of them were deadly dull, and many were
financial failures. "Many," did I say? The president of one of the
largest publishing houses in the world confessed to me that his
company, after seventy-five years of publishing experience, still lost
money on seven out of every eight books it published.
Why, then, did I have the temerity to write another book? And, after
I had written it, why should you bother to read it?
Fair questions, both; and I'll try to answer them.
I have, since 1912, been conducting educational courses for business
and professional men and women in New York. At first, I conducted
courses in public speaking only - courses designed to train adults, by
actual experience, to think on their feet and express their ideas with
more clarity, more effectiveness and more poise, both in business
interviews and before groups.
But gradually, as the seasons passed, I realized that as sorely as
these adults needed training in effective speaking, they needed still
more training in the fine art of getting along with people in everyday
business and social contacts.
I also gradually realized that I was sorely in need of such training
myself. As I look back across the years, I am appalled at my own
frequent lack of finesse and understanding. How I wish a book such
as this had been placed in my hands twenty years ago! What a
priceless boon it would have been.
Dealing with people is probably the biggest problem you face,
especially if you are in business. Yes, and that is also true if you are
a housewife, architect or engineer. Research done a few years ago
under the auspices of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement
of Teaching uncovered a most important and significant fact - a fact
later confirmed by additional studies made at the Carnegie Institute
of Technology. These investigations revealed that even in such
technical lines as engineering, about 15 percent of one's financial
success is due to one's technical knowledge and about 85 percent is
due to skill in human engineering-to personality and the ability to
lead people.
For many years, I conducted courses each season at the Engineers'
Club of Philadelphia, and also courses for the New York Chapter of
the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. A total of probably
more than fifteen hundred engineers have passed through my
classes. They came to me because they had finally realized, after
years of observation and experience, that the highest-paid personnel
in engineering are frequently not those who know the most about
engineering. One can for example, hire mere technical ability in
engineering, accountancy, architecture or any other profession at
nominal salaries. But the person who has technical knowledge plus
the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse
enthusiasm among people-that person is headed for higher earning
power.
In the heyday of his activity, John D. Rockefeller said that "the ability
to deal with people is as purchasable a commodity as sugar or
coffee." "And I will pay more for that ability," said John D., "than for
any other under the sun."
Wouldn't you suppose that every college in the land would conduct
courses to develop the highest-priced ability under the sun? But if
there is just one practical, common-sense course of that kind given
for adults in even one college in the land, it has escaped my
attention up to the present writing.
The University of Chicago and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools conducted
a survey to determine what adults want to study.
That survey cost $25,000 and took two years. The last part of the
survey was made in Meriden, Connecticut. It had been chosen as a
typical American town. Every adult in Meriden was interviewed and
requested to answer 156 questions-questions such as "What is your
business or profession? Your education? How do you spend your
spare time? What is your income? Your hobbies? Your ambitions?
Your problems? What subjects are you most interested in studying?"
And so on. That survey revealed that health is the prime interest of
adults and that their second interest is people; how to understand
and get along with people; how to make people like you; and how to
win others to your way of thinking.
So the committee conducting this survey resolved to conduct such a
course for adults in Meriden. They searched diligently for a practical
textbook on the subject and found-not one. Finally they approached
one of the world's outstanding authorities on adult education and
asked him if he knew of any book that met the needs of this group.
"No," he replied, "I know what those adults want. But the book they
need has never been written."
I knew from experience that this statement was true, for I myself
had been searching for years to discover a practical, working
handbook on human relations.
Since no such book existed, I have tried to write one for use in my
own courses. And here it is. I hope you like it.
In preparation for this book, I read everything that I could find on
the subject- everything from newspaper columns, magazine articles,
records of the family courts, the writings of the old philosophers and
the new psychologists. In addition, I hired a trained researcher to
spend one and a half years in various libraries reading everything I
had missed, plowing through erudite tomes on psychology, poring
over hundreds of magazine articles, searching through countless
biographies, trying to ascertain how the great leaders of all ages had
dealt with people. We read their biographies, We read the life stories
of all great leaders from Julius Caesar to Thomas Edison. I recall that
we read over one hundred biographies of Theodore Roosevelt alone.
We were determined to spare no time, no expense, to discover every
practical idea that anyone had ever used throughout the ages for
winning friends and influencing people.
I personally interviewed scores of successful people, some of them
world-famous-inventors like Marconi and Edison; political leaders like
Franklin D. Roosevelt and James Farley; business leaders like Owen
D. Young; movie stars like Clark Gable and Mary Pickford; and
explorers like Martin Johnson-and tried to discover the techniques
they used in human relations.
From all this material, I prepared a short talk. I called it "How to Win
Friends and Influence People." I say "short." It was short in the
beginning, but it soon expanded to a lecture that consumed one
hour and thirty minutes. For years, I gave this talk each season to
the adults in the Carnegie Institute courses in New York.
I gave the talk and urged the listeners to go out and test it in their
business and social contacts, and then come back to class and speak
about their experiences and the results they had achieved. What an
interesting assignment! These men and women, hungry for selfimprovement,
were fascinated by the idea of working in a new kind
of laboratory - the first and only laboratory of human relationships
for adults that had ever existed.
This book wasn't written in the usual sense of the word. It grew as a
child grows. It grew and developed out of that laboratory, out of the
experiences of thousands of adults.
Years ago, we started with a set of rules printed on a card no larger
than a postcard. The next season we printed a larger card, then a
leaflet, then a series of booklets, each one expanding in size and
scope. After fifteen years of experiment and research came this
book.
The rules we have set down here are not mere theories or
guesswork. They work like magic. Incredible as it sounds, I have
seen the application of these principles literally revolutionize the lives
of many people.
To illustrate: A man with 314 employees joined one of these courses.
For years, he had driven and criticized and condemned his
employees without stint or discretion. Kindness, words of
appreciation and encouragement were alien to his lips. After studying
the principles discussed in this book, this employer sharply altered
his philosophy of life. His organization is now inspired with a new
loyalty, a new enthusiasm, a new spirit of team-work. Three hundred
and fourteen enemies have been turned into 314 friends. As he
proudly said in a speech before the class: "When I used to walk
through my establishment, no one greeted me. My employees
actually looked the other way when they saw me approaching. But
now they are all my friends and even the janitor calls me by my first
name."
This employer gained more profit, more leisure and -what is infinitely
more important-he found far more happiness in his business and in
his home.
Countless numbers of salespeople have sharply increased their sales
by the use of these principles. Many have opened up new accounts -
accounts that they had formerly solicited in vain. Executives have
been given increased authority, increased pay. One executive
reported a large increase in salary because he applied these truths.
Another, an executive in the Philadelphia Gas Works Company, was
slated for demotion when he was sixty-five because of his
belligerence, because of his inability to lead people skillfully. This
training not only saved him from the demotion but brought him a
promotion with increased pay.
On innumerable occasions, spouses attending the banquet given at
the end of the course have told me that their homes have been
much happier since their husbands or wives started this training.
People are frequently astonished at the new results they achieve. It
all seems like magic. In some cases, in their enthusiasm, they have
telephoned me at my home on Sundays because they couldn't wait
forty-eight hours to report their achievements at the regular session
of the course.
One man was so stirred by a talk on these principles that he sat far
into the night discussing them with other members of the class. At
three o'clock in the morning, the others went home. But he was so
shaken by a realization of his own mistakes, so inspired by the vista
of a new and richer world opening before him, that he was unable to
sleep. He didn't sleep that night or the next day or the next night.
Who was he? A naive, untrained individual ready to gush over any
new theory that came along? No, Far from it. He was a sophisticated,
blas§Û dealer in art, very much the man about town, who spoke three
languages fluently and was a graduate of two European universities.
While writing this chapter, I received a letter from a German of the
old school, an aristocrat whose forebears had served for generations
as professional army officers under the Hohenzollerns. His letter,
written from a transatlantic steamer, telling about the application of
these principles, rose almost to a religious fervor.
Another man, an old New Yorker, a Harvard graduate, a wealthy
man, the owner of a large carpet factory, declared he had learned
more in fourteen weeks through this system of training about the
fine art of influencing people than he had learned about the same
subject during his four years in college. Absurd? Laughable?
Fantastic? Of course, you are privileged to dismiss this statement
with whatever adjective you wish. I am merely reporting, without
comment, a declaration made by a conservative and eminently
successful Harvard graduate in a public address to approximately six
hundred people at the Yale Club in New York on the evening of
Thursday, February 23, 1933.
"Compared to what we ought to be," said the famous Professor
William James of Harvard, "compared to what we ought to be, we
are only half awake. We are making use of only a small part of our
physical and mental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human
individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses powers of
various sorts which he habitually fails to use,"
Those powers which you "habitually fail to use"! The sole purpose of
this book is to help you discover, develop and profit by those
dormant and unused assets,
"Education," said Dr. John G. Hibben, former president of Princeton
University, "is the ability to meet life's situations,"
If by the time you have finished reading the first three chapters of
this book- if you aren't then a little better equipped to meet life's
situations, then I shall consider this book to be a total failure so far
as you are concerned. For "the great aim of education," said Herbert
Spencer, "is not knowledge but action."
And this is an action book.

Nine Suggestions on How to Get the Most Out of This Book
1. If you wish to get the most out of this book, there is one
indispensable requirement, one essential infinitely more important
than any rule or technique. Unless you have this one fundamental
requisite, a thousand rules on how to study will avail little, And if you
do have this cardinal endowment, then you can achieve wonders
without reading any suggestions for getting the most out of a book.
What is this magic requirement? Just this: a deep, driving desire to
learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with
people.
How can you develop such an urge? By constantly reminding yourself
how important these principles are to you. Picture to yourself how
their mastery will aid you in leading a richer, fuller, happier and more
fulfilling life. Say to yourself over and over: "My popularity, my
happiness and sense of worth depend to no small extent upon my
skill in dealing with people."
2. Read each chapter rapidly at first to get a bird's-eye view of it.
You will probably be tempted then to rush on to the next one. But
don't - unless you are reading merely for entertainment. But if you
are reading because you want to increase your skill in human
relations, then go back and reread each chapter thoroughly. In the
long run, this will mean saving time and getting results.
3. Stop frequently in your reading to think over what you are
reading. Ask yourself just how and when you can apply each
suggestion.
4. Read with a crayon, pencil, pen, magic marker or highlighter in
your hand. When you come across a suggestion that you feel you
can use, draw a line beside it. If it is a four-star suggestion, then
underscore every sentence or highlight it, or mark it with "****."
Marking and underscoring a book makes it more interesting, and far
easier to review rapidly.
5. I knew a woman who had been office manager for a large
insurance concern for fifteen years. Every month, she read all the
insurance contracts her company had issued that month. Yes, she
read many of the same contracts over month after month, year after
year. Why? Because experience had taught her that that was the
only way she could keep their provisions clearly in mind. I once spent
almost two years writing a book on public speaking and yet I found I
had to keep going back over it from time to time in order to
remember what I had written in my own book. The rapidity with
which we forget is astonishing.
So, if you want to get a real, lasting benefit out of this book, don't
imagine that skimming through it once will suffice. After reading it
thoroughly, you ought to spend a few hours reviewing it every
month, Keep it on your desk in front of you every day. Glance
through it often. Keep constantly impressing yourself with the rich
possibilities for improvement that still lie in the offing. Remember
that the use of these principles can be made habitual only by a
constant and vigorous campaign of review and application. There is
no other way.
6. Bernard Shaw once remarked: "If you teach a man anything, he
will never learn." Shaw was right. Learning is an active process. We
learn by doing. So, if you desire to master the principles you are
studying in this book, do something about them. Apply these rules at
every opportunity. If you don't you will forget them quickly. Only
knowledge that is used sticks in your mind.
You will probably find it difficult to apply these suggestions all the
time. I know because I wrote the book, and yet frequently I found it
difficult to apply everything I advocated. For example, when you are
displeased, it is much easier to criticize and condemn than it is to try
to understand the other person's viewpoint. It is frequently easier to
find fault than to find praise. It is more natural to talk about what
vou want than to talk about what the other person wants. And so on,
So, as you read this book, remember that you are not merely trying
to acquire information. You are attempting to form new habits. Ah
yes, you are attempting a new way of life. That will require time and
persistence and daily application.
So refer to these pages often. Regard this as a working handbook on
human relations; and whenever you are confronted with some
specific problem - such as handling a child, winning your spouse to
your way of thinking, or satisfying an irritated customer - hesitate
about doing the natural thing, the impulsive thing. This is usually
wrong. Instead, turn to these pages and review the paragraphs you
have underscored. Then try these new ways and watch them achieve
magic for you.
7. Offer your spouse, your child or some business associate a dime
or a dollar every time he or she catches you violating a certain
principle. Make a lively game out of mastering these rules.
8. The president of an important Wall Street bank once described, in
a talk before one of my classes, a highly efficient system he used for
self-improvement. This man had little formal schooling; yet he had
become one of the most important financiers in America, and he
confessed that he owed most of his success to the constant
application of his homemade system. This is what he does, I'll put it
in his own words as accurately as I can remember.
"For years I have kept an engagement book showing all the
appointments I had during the day. My family never made any plans
for me on Saturday night, for the family knew that I devoted a part
of each Saturday evening to the illuminating process of selfexamination
and review and appraisal. After dinner I went off by
myself, opened my engagement book, and thought over all the
interviews, discussions and meetings that had taken place during the
week. I asked myself:
'What mistakes did I make that time?' 'What did I do that was rightand
in what way could I have improved my performance?' 'What
lessons can I learn from that experience?'
"I often found that this weekly review made me very unhappy. I was
frequently astonished at my own blunders. Of course, as the years
passed, these blunders became less frequent. Sometimes I was
inclined to pat myself on the back a little after one of these sessions.
This system of self-analysis, self-education, continued year after
year, did more for me than any other one thing I have ever
attempted.
"It helped me improve my ability to make decisions - and it aided me
enormously in all my contacts with people. I cannot recommend it
too highly."
Why not use a similar system to check up on your application of the
principles discussed in this book? If you do, two things will result.
First, you will find yourself engaged in an educational process that is
both intriguing and priceless.
Second, you will find that your ability to meet and deal with people
will grow enormously.
9. You will find at the end of this book several blank pages on which
you should record your triumphs in the application of these
principles. Be specific. Give names, dates, results. Keeping such a
record will inspire you to greater efforts; and how fascinating these
entries will be when you chance upon them some evening years from
now!
In order to get the most out of this book:
? a. Develop a deep, driving desire to master the principles of human
relations,
? b. Read each chapter twice before going on to the next one.
? c. As you read, stop frequently to ask yourself how you can apply
each suggestion.
? d. Underscore each important idea.
? e. Review this book each month.
? f. Apply these principles at every opportunity. Use this volume as a
working handbook to help you solve your daily problems.
? g. Make a lively game out of your learning by offering some friend
a dime or a dollar every time he or she catches you violating one of
these principles.
? h. Check up each week on the progress you are mak-ing. Ask
yourself what mistakes you have made, what improvement, what
lessons you have learned for the future.
? i. Keep notes in the back of this book showing how and when you
have applied these principles.

A Shortcut to Distinction
by Lowell Thomas
This biographical information about Dale Carnegie was written as an
introduction to the original edition of How to Win Friends and
Influence People. It is reprinted in this edition to give the readers
additional background on Dale Carnegie.
It was a cold January night in 1935, but the weather couldn't keep
them away. Two thousand five hundred men and women thronged
into the grand ballroom of the Hotel Pennsylvania in New York. Every
available seat was filled by half-past seven. At eight o'clock, the
eager crowd was still pouring in. The spacious balcony was soon
jammed. Presently even standing space was at a premium, and
hundreds of people, tired after navigating a day in business, stood
up for an hour and a half that night to witness - what?
A fashion show?
A six-day bicycle race or a personal appearance by Clark Gable?
No. These people had been lured there by a newspaper ad. Two
evenings previously, they had seen this full-page announcement in
the New York Sun staring them in the face:
Learn to Speak Effectively Prepare for Leadership
Old stuff? Yes, but believe it or not, in the most sophisticated town
on earth, during a depression with 20 percent of the population on
relief, twenty-five hundred people had left their homes and hustled
to the hotel in response to that ad.
The people who responded were of the upper economic strata -
executives, employers and professionals.
These men and women had come to hear the opening gun of an
ultramodern, ultrapractical course in "Effective Speaking and
Influencing Men in Business"- a course given by the Dale Carnegie
Institute of Effective Speaking and Human Relations.
Why were they there, these twenty-five hundred business men and
women?
Because of a sudden hunger for more education because of the
depression?
Apparently not, for this same course had been playing to packed
houses in New York City every season for the preceding twenty-four
years. During that time, more than fifteen thousand business and
professional people had been trained by Dale Carnegie. Even large,
skeptical, conservative organizations such as the Westinghouse
Electric Company, the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, the Brooklyn
Union Gas Company, the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, the
American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the New York
Telephone Company have had this training conducted in their own
offices for the benefit of their members and executives.
The fact that these people, ten or twenty years after leaving grade
school, high school or college, come and take this training is a
glaring commentary on the shocking deficiencies of our educational
system.
What do adults really want to study? That is an important question;
and in order to answer it, the University of Chicago, the American
Association for Adult Education, and the United Y.M.C.A. Schools
made a survey over a two-year period.
That survey revealed that the prime interest of adults is health. It
also revealed that their second interest is in developing skill in
human relationships - they want to learn the technique of getting
along with and influencing other people. They don't want to become
public speakers, and they don't want to listen to a lot of high
sounding talk about psychology; they want suggestions they can use
immediately in business, in social contacts and in the home.
So that was what adults wanted to study, was it?
"All right," said the people making the survey. "Fine. If that is what
they want, we'll give it to them."
Looking around for a textbook, they discovered that no working
manual had ever been written to help people solve their daily
problems in human relationships.
Here was a fine kettle of fish! For hundreds of years, learned
volumes had been written on Greek and Latin and higher
mathematics - topics about which the average adult doesn't give two
hoots. But on the one subject on which he has a thirst for
knowledge, a veritable passion for guidance and help - nothing!
This explained the presence of twenty-five hundred eager adults
crowding into the grand ballroom of the Hotel Pennsylvania in
response to a newspaper advertisement. Here, apparently, at last
was the thing for which they had long been seeking.
Back in high school and college, they had pored over books,
believing that knowledge alone was the open sesame to financial -
and professional rewards.
But a few years in the rough-and-tumble of business and
professional life had brought sharp dissillusionment. They had seen
some of the most important business successes won by men who
possessed, in addition to their knowledge, the ability to talk well, to
win people to their way of thinking, and to "sell" themselves and
their ideas.
They soon discovered that if one aspired to wear the captain's cap
and navigate the ship of business, personality and the ability to talk
are more important than a knowledge of Latin verbs or a sheepskin
from Harvard.
The advertisement in the New York Sun promised that the meeting
would be highly entertaining. It was. Eighteen people who had taken
the course were marshaled in front of the loudspeaker - and fifteen
of them were given precisely seventy-five seconds each to tell his or
her story. Only seventy-five seconds of talk, then "bang" went the
gavel, and the chairman shouted, "Time! Next speaker!"
The affair moved with the speed of a herd of buffalo thundering
across the plains. Spectators stood for an hour and a half to watch
the performance.
The speakers were a cross section of life: several sales
representatives, a chain store executive, a baker, the president of a
trade association, two bankers, an insurance agent, an accountant, a
dentist, an architect, a druggist who had come from Indianapolis to
New York to take the course, a lawyer who had come from Havana
in order to prepare himself to give one important three-minute
speech.
The first speaker bore the Gaelic name Patrick J. O'Haire. Born in
Ireland, he attended school for only four years, drifted to America,
worked as a mechanic, then as a chauffeur.
Now, however, he was forty, he had a growing family and needed
more money, so he tried selling trucks. Suffering from an inferiority
complex that, as he put it, was eating his heart out, he had to walk
up and down in front of an office half a dozen times before he could
summon up enough courage to open the door. He was so
discouraged as a salesman that he was thinking of going back to
working with his hands in a machine shop, when one day he
received a letter inviting him to an organization meeting of the Dale
Carnegie Course in Effective Speaking.
He didn't want to attend. He feared he would have to associate with
a lot of college graduates, that he would be out of place.
His despairing wife insisted that he go, saying, "It may do you some
good, Pat. God knows you need it." He went down to the place
where the meeting was to be held and stood on the sidewalk for five
minutes before he could generate enough self-confidence to enter
the room.
The first few times he tried to speak in front of the others, he was
dizzy with fear. But as the weeks drifted by, he lost all fear of
audiences and soon found that he loved to talk - the bigger the
crowd, the better. And he also lost his fear of individuals and of his
superiors. He presented his ideas to them, and soon he had been
advanced into the sales department. He had become a valued and
much liked member of his company. This night, in the Hotel
Pennsylvania, Patrick O'Haire stood in front of twenty-five hundred
people and told a gay, rollicking story of his achievements. Wave
after wave of laughter swept over the audience. Few professional
speakers could have equaled his performance.
The next speaker, Godfrey Meyer, was a gray-headed banker, the
father of eleven children. The first time he had attempted to speak in
class, he was literally struck dumb. His mind refused to function. His
story is a vivid illustration of how leadership gravitates to the person
who can talk.
He worked on Wall Street, and for twenty-five years he had been
living in Clifton, New Jersey. During that time, he had taken no
active part in community affairs and knew perhaps five hundred
people.
Shortly after he had enrolled in the Carnegie course, he received his
tax bill and was infuriated by what he considered unjust charges.
Ordinarily, he would have sat at home and fumed, or he would have
taken it out in grousing to his neighbors. But instead, he put on his
hat that night, walked into the town meeting, and blew off steam in
public.
As a result of that talk of indignation, the citizens of Clifton, New
Jersey, urged him to run for the town council. So for weeks he went
from one meeting to another, denouncing waste and municipal
extravagance.
There were ninety-six candidates in the field. When the ballots were
counted, lo, Godfrey Meyer's name led all the rest. Almost overnight,
he had become a public figure among the forty thousand people in
his community. As a result of his talks, he made eighty times more
friends in six weeks than he had been able to previously in twentyfive
years.
And his salary as councilman meant that he got a return of 1,000
percent a year on his investment in the Carnegie course.
The third speaker, the head of a large national association of food
manufacturers, told how he had been unable to stand up and
express his ideas at meetings of a board of directors.
As a result of learning to think on his feet, two astonishing things
happened. He was soon made president of his association, and in
that capacity, he was obliged to address meetings all over the United
States. Excerpts from his talks were put on the Associated Press
wires and printed in newspapers and trade magazines throughout
the country.
In two years, after learning to speak more effectively, he received
more free publicity for his company and its products than he had
been able to get previously with a quarter of a million dollars spent
in direct advertising. This speaker admitted that he had formerly
hesitated to telephone some of the more important business
executives in Manhattan and invite them to lunch with him. But as a
result of the prestige he had acquired by his talks, these same
people telephoned him and invited him to lunch and apologized to
him for encroaching on his time.
The ability to speak is a shortcut to distinction. It puts a person in
the limelight, raises one head and shoulders above the crowd. And
the person who can speak acceptably is usually given credit for an
ability out of all proportion to what he or she really possesses.
A movement for adult education has been sweeping over the nation;
and the most spectacular force in that movement was Dale Carnegie,
a man who listened to and critiqued more talks by adults than has
any other man in captivity. According to a cartoon by "Believe-It-or-
Not" Ripley, he had criticized 150,000 speeches. If that grand total
doesn't impress you, remember that it meant one talk for almost
every day that has passed since Columbus discovered America. Or,
to put it in other words, if all the people who had spoken before him
had used only three minutes and had appeared before him in
succession, it would have taken ten months, listening day and night,
to hear them all.
Dale Carnegie's own career, filled with sharp contrasts, was a striking
example of what a person can accomplish when obsessed with an
original idea and afire with enthusiasm.
Born on a Missouri farm ten miles from a railway, he never saw a
streetcar until he was twelve years old; yet by the time he was fortysix,
he was familiar with the far-flung corners of the earth,
everywhere from Hong Kong to Hammerfest; and, at one time, he
approached closer to the North Pole than Admiral Byrd's
headquarters at Little America was to the South Pole.
This Missouri lad who had once picked strawberries and cut
cockleburs for five cents an hour became the highly paid trainer of
the executives of large corporations in the art of self-expression.
This erstwhile cowboy who had once punched cattle and branded
calves and ridden fences out in western South Dakota later went to
London to put on shows under the patronage of the royal family.
This chap who was a total failure the first half-dozen times he tried
to speak in public later became my personal manager. Much of my
success has been due to training under Dale Carnegie.
Young Carnegie had to struggle for an education, for hard luck was
always battering away at the old farm in northwest Missouri with a
flying tackle and a body slam. Year after year, the "102" River rose
and drowned the corn and swept away the hay. Season after season,
the fat hogs sickened and died from cholera, the bottom fell out of
the market for cattle and mules, and the bank threatened to
foreclose the mortgage.
Sick with discouragement, the family sold out and bought another
farm near the State Teachers' College at Warrensburg, Missouri.
Board and room could be had in town for a dollar a day, but young
Carnegie couldn't afford it. So he stayed on the farm and commuted
on horseback three miles to college each day. At home, he milked
the cows, cut the wood, fed the hogs, and studied his Latin verbs by
the light of a coal-oil lamp until his eyes blurred and he began to
nod.
Even when he got to bed at midnight, he set the alarm for three
o'clock. His father bred pedigreed Duroc-Jersey hogs - and there was
danger, during the bitter cold nights, that the young pigs would
freeze to death; so they were put in a basket, covered with a gunny
sack, and set behind the kitchen stove. True to their nature, the pigs
demanded a hot meal at 3 A.M. So when the alarm went off, Dale
Carnegie crawled out of the blankets, took the basket of pigs out to
their mother, waited for them to nurse, and then brought them back
to the warmth of the kitchen stove.
There were six hundred students in State Teachers' College, and
Dale Carnegie was one of the isolated half-dozen who couldn't afford
to board in town. He was ashamed of the poverty that made it
necessary for him to ride back to the farm and milk the cows every
night. He was ashamed of his coat, which was too tight, and his
trousers, which were too short. Rapidly developing an inferiority
complex, he looked about for some shortcut to distinction. He soon
saw that there were certain groups in college that enjoyed influence
and prestige - the football and baseball players and the chaps who
won the debating and public-speaking contests.
Realizing that he had no flair for athletics, he decided to win one of
the speaking contests. He spent months preparing his talks. He
practiced as he sat in the saddle galloping to college and back; he
practiced his speeches as he milked the cows; and then he mounted
a bale of hay in the barn and with great gusto and gestures
harangued the frightened pigeons about the issues of the day.
But in spite of all his earnestness and preparation, he met with
defeat after defeat. He was eighteen at the time - sensitive and
proud. He became so discouraged, so depressed, that he even
thought of suicide. And then suddenly he began to win, not one
contest, but every speaking contest in college.
Other students pleaded with him to train them; and they won also.
After graduating from college, he started selling correspondence
courses to the ranchers among the sand hills of western Nebraska
and eastern Wyoming. In spite of all his boundless energy and
enthusiasm, he couldn't make the grade. He became so discouraged
that he went to his hotel room in Alliance, Nebraska, in the middle of
the day, threw himself across the bed, and wept in despair. He
longed to go back to college, he longed to retreat from the harsh
battle of life; but he couldn't. So he resolved to go to Omaha and get
another job. He didn't have the money for a railroad ticket, so he
traveled on a freight train, feeding and watering two carloads of wild
horses in return for his passage, After landing in south Omaha, he
got a job selling bacon and soap and lard for Armour and Company.
His territory was up among the Badlands and the cow and Indian
country of western South Dakota. He covered his territory by freight
train and stage coach and horseback and slept in pioneer hotels
where the only partition between the rooms was a sheet of muslin.
He studied books on salesmanship, rode bucking bronchos, played
poker with the Indians, and learned how to collect money. And
when, for example, an inland storekeeper couldn't pay cash for the
bacon and hams he had ordered, Dale Carnegie would take a dozen
pairs of shoes off his shelf, sell the shoes to the railroad men, and
forward the receipts to Armour and Company.
He would often ride a freight train a hundred miles a day. When the
train stopped to unload freight, he would dash uptown, see three or
four merchants, get his orders; and when the whistle blew, he would
dash down the street again lickety-split and swing onto the train
while it was moving.
Within two years, he had taken an unproductive territory that had
stood in the twenty-fifth place and had boosted it to first place
among all the twenty-nine car routes leading out of south Omaha.
Armour and Company offered to promote him, saying: "You have
achieved what seemed impossible." But he refused the promotion
and resigned, went to New York, studied at the American Academy
of Dramatic Arts, and toured the country, playing the role of Dr.
Hartley in Polly of the Circus.
He would never be a Booth or a Barrymore. He had the good sense
to recognize that, So back he went to sales work, selling automobiles
and trucks for the Packard Motor Car Company.
He knew nothing about machinery and cared nothing about it.
Dreadfully unhappy, he had to scourge himself to his task each day.
He longed to have time to study, to write the books he had dreamed
about writing back in college. So he resigned. He was going to spend
his days writing stories and novels and support himself by teaching
in a night school.
Teaching what? As he looked back and evaluated his college work,
he saw that his training in public speaking had done more to give
him confidence, courage, poise and the ability to meet and deal with
people in business than had all the rest of his college courses put
together, So he urged the Y.M.C.A. schools in New York to give him
a chance to conduct courses in public speaking for people in
business.
What? Make orators out of business people? Absurd. The Y.M.C.A.
people knew. They had tried such courses -and they had always
failed. When they refused to pay him a salary of two dollars a night,
he agreed to teach on a commission basis and take a percentage of
the net profits -if there were any profits to take. And inside of three
years they were paying him thirty dollars a night on that basis -
instead of two.
The course grew. Other "Ys" heard of it, then other cities. Dale
Carnegie soon became a glorified circuit rider covering New York,
Philadelphia, Baltimore and later London and Paris. All the textbooks
were too academic and impractical for the business people who
flocked to his courses. Because of this he wrote his own book
entitled Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business. It became
the official text of all the Y.M.C.A.s as well as of the American
Bankers' Association and the National Credit Men's Association.
Dale Carnegie claimed that all people can talk when they get mad.
He said that if you hit the most ignorant man in town on the jaw and
knock him down, he would get on his feet and talk with an
eloquence, heat and emphasis that would have rivaled that world
famous orator William Jennings Bryan at the height of his career. He
claimed that almost any person can speak acceptably in public if he
or she has self-confidence and an idea that is boiling and stewing
within.
The way to develop self-confidence, he said, is to do the thing you
fear to do and get a record of successful experiences behind you. So
he forced each class member to talk at every session of the course.
The audience is sympathetic. They are all in the same boat; and, by
constant practice, they develop a courage, confidence and
enthusiasm that carry over into their private speaking.
Dale Carnegie would tell you that he made a living all these years,
not by teaching public speaking - that was incidental. His main job
was to help people conquer their fears and develop courage.
He started out at first to conduct merely a course in public speaking,
but the students who came were business men and women. Many of
them hadn't seen the inside of a classroom in thirty years. Most of
them were paying their tuition on the installment plan. They wanted
results and they wanted them quick - results that they could use the
next day in business interviews and in speaking before groups.
So he was forced to be swift and practical. Consequently, he
developed a system of training that is unique - a striking combination
of public speaking, salesmanship, human relations and applied
psychology.
A slave to no hard-and-fast rules, he developed a course that is as
real as the measles and twice as much fun.
When the classes terminated, the graduates formed clubs of their
own and continued to meet fortnightly for years afterward. One
group of nineteen in Philadelphia met twice a month during the
winter season for seventeen years. Class members frequently travel
fifty or a hundred miles to attend classes. One student used to
commute each week from Chicago to New York. Professor William
James of Harvard used to say that the average person develops only
10 percent of his latent mental ability. Dale Carnegie, by helping
business men and women to develop their latent possibilities,
created one of the most significant movements in adult education

Part One - Fundamental Techniques In Handling People
1 "If You Want To Gather Honey, Don't Kick Over The Beehive"
On May 7, 1931, the most sensational manhunt New York City had
ever known had come to its climax. After weeks of search, "Two
Gun" Crowley - the killer, the gunman who didn't smoke or drink -
was at bay, trapped in his sweetheart's apartment on West End
Avenue.
One hundred and fifty policemen and detectives laid siege to his topfloor
hideway. They chopped holes in the roof; they tried to smoke
out Crowley, the "cop killer," with teargas. Then they mounted their
machine guns on surrounding buildings, and for more than an hour
one of New York's fine residential areas reverberated with the crack
of pistol fire and the rut-tat-tat of machine guns. Crowley, crouching
behind an over-stuffed chair, fired incessantly at the police. Ten
thousand excited people watched the battle. Nothing like it ever
been seen before on the sidewalks of New York.
When Crowley was captured, Police Commissioner E. P. Mulrooney
declared that the two-gun desperado was one of the most dangerous
criminals ever encountered in the history of New York. "He will kill,"
said the Commissioner, "at the drop of a feather."
But how did "Two Gun" Crowley regard himself? We know, because
while the police were firing into his apartment, he wrote a letter
addressed "To whom it may concern, " And, as he wrote, the blood
flowing from his wounds left a crimson trail on the paper. In this
letter Crowley said: "Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one
- one that would do nobody any harm."
A short time before this, Crowley had been having a necking party
with his girl friend on a country road out on Long Island. Suddenly a
policeman walked up to the car and said: "Let me see your license."
Without saying a word, Crowley drew his gun and cut the policeman
down with a shower of lead. As the dying officer fell, Crowley leaped
out of the car, grabbed the officer's revolver, and fired another bullet
into the prostrate body. And that was the killer who said: "Under my
coat is a weary heart, but a kind one - one that would do nobody
any harm.'
Crowley was sentenced to the electric chair. When he arrived at the
death house in Sing Sing, did he say, "This is what I get for killing
people"? No, he said: "This is what I get for defending myself."
The point of the story is this: "Two Gun" Crowley didn't blame
himself for anything.
Is that an unusual attitude among criminals? If you think so, listen to
this:
"I have spent the best years of my life giving people the lighter
pleasures, helping them have a good time, and all I get is abuse, the
existence of a hunted man."
That's Al Capone speaking. Yes, America's most notorious Public
Enemy- the most sinister gang leader who ever shot up Chicago.
Capone didn't condemn himself. He actually regarded himself as a
public benefactor - an unappreciated and misunderstood public
benefactor.
And so did Dutch Schultz before he crumpled up under gangster
bullets in Newark. Dutch Schultz, one of New York's most notorious
rats, said in a newspaper interview that he was a public benefactor.
And he believed it.
I have had some interesting correspondence with Lewis Lawes, who
was warden of New York's infamous Sing Sing prison for many years,
on this subject, and he declared that "few of the criminals in Sing
Sing regard themselves as bad men. They are just as human as you
and I. So they rationalize, they explain. They can tell you why they
had to crack a safe or be quick on the trigger finger. Most of them
attempt by a form of reasoning, fallacious or logical, to justify their
antisocial acts even to themselves, consequently stoutly maintaining
that they should never have been imprisoned at all."
If Al Capone, "Two Gun" Crowley, Dutch Schultz, and the desperate
men and women behind prison walls don't blame themselves for
anything - what about the people with whom you and I come in
contact?
John Wanamaker, founder of the stores that bear his name, once
confessed: "I learned thirty years ago that it is foolish to scold. I
have enough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting
over the fact that God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of
intelligence."
Wanamaker learned this lesson early, but I personally had to blunder
through this old world for a third of a century before it even began
to dawn upon me that ninety-nine times out of a hundred, people
don't criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may
be.
Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and
usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous,
because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of
importance, and arouses resentment.
B. F. Skinner, the world-famous psychologist, proved through his
experiments that an animal rewarded for good behavior will learn
much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than
an animal punished for bad behavior. Later studies have shown that
the same applies to humans. By criticizing, we do not make lasting
changes and often incur resentment.
Hans Selye, another great psychologist, said, "As much as we thirst
for approval, we dread condemnation,"
The resentment that criticism engenders can demoralize employees,
family members and friends, and still not correct the situation that
has been condemned.
George B. Johnston of Enid, Oklahoma, is the safety coordinator for
an engineering company, One of his re-sponsibilities is to see that
employees wear their hard hats whenever they are on the job in the
field. He reported that whenever he came across workers who were
not wearing hard hats, he would tell them with a lot of authority of
the regulation and that they must comply. As a result he would get
sullen acceptance, and often after he left, the workers would remove
the hats.
He decided to try a different approach. The next time he found some
of the workers not wearing their hard hat, he asked if the hats were
uncomfortable or did not fit properly. Then he reminded the men in a
pleasant tone of voice that the hat was designed to protect them
from injury and suggested that it always be worn on the job. The
result was increased compliance with the regulation with no
resentment or emotional upset.
You will find examples of the futility of criticism bristling on a
thousand pages of history, Take, for example, the famous quarrel
between Theodore Roosevelt and President Taft - a quarrel that split
the Republican party, put Woodrow Wilson in the White House, and
wrote bold, luminous lines across the First World War and altered the
flow of history. Let's review the facts quickly. When Theodore
Roosevelt stepped out of the White House in 1908, he supported
Taft, who was elected President. Then Theodore Roosevelt went off
to Africa to shoot lions. When he returned, he exploded. He
denounced Taft for his conservatism, tried to secure the nomination
for a third term himself, formed the Bull Moose party, and all but
demolished the G.O.P. In the election that followed, William Howard
Taft and the Republican party carried only two states - Vermont and
Utah. The most disastrous defeat the party had ever known.
Theodore Roosevelt blamed Taft, but did President Taft blame
himself? Of course not, With tears in his eyes, Taft said: "I don't see
how I could have done any differently from what I have."
Who was to blame? Roosevelt or Taft? Frankly, I don't know, and I
don't care. The point I am trying to make is that all of Theodore
Roosevelt's criticism didn't persuade Taft that he was wrong. It
merely made Taft strive to justify himself and to reiterate with tears
in his eyes: "I don't see how I could have done any differently from
what I have."
Or, take the Teapot Dome oil scandal. It kept the newspapers ringing
with indignation in the early 1920s. It rocked the nation! Within the
memory of living men, nothing like it had ever happened before in
American public life. Here are the bare facts of the scandal: Albert B.
Fall, secretary of the interior in Harding's cabinet, was entrusted with
the leasing of government oil reserves at Elk Hill and Teapot Dome -
oil reserves that had been set aside for the future use of the Navy.
Did secretary Fall permit competitive bidding? No sir. He handed the
fat, juicy contract outright to his friend Edward L. Doheny. And what
did Doheny do? He gave Secretary Fall what he was pleased to call a
"loan" of one hundred thousand dollars. Then, in a high-handed
manner, Secretary Fall ordered United States Marines into the district
to drive off competitors whose adjacent wells were sapping oil out of
the Elk Hill reserves. These competitors, driven off their ground at
the ends of guns and bayonets, rushed into court - and blew the lid
off the Teapot Dome scandal. A stench arose so vile that it ruined
the Harding Administration, nauseated an entire nation, threatened
to wreck the Republican party, and put Albert B. Fall behind prison
bars.
Fall was condemned viciously - condemned as few men in public life
have ever been. Did he repent? Never! Years later Herbert Hoover
intimated in a public speech that President Harding's death had been
due to mental anxiety and worry because a friend had betrayed him.
When Mrs. Fall heard that, she sprang from her chair, she wept, she
shook her fists at fate and screamed: "What! Harding betrayed by
Fall? No! My husband never betrayed anyone. This whole house full
of gold would not tempt my husband to do wrong. He is the one who
has been betrayed and led to the slaughter and crucified."
There you are; human nature in action, wrongdoers, blaming
everybody but themselves. We are all like that. So when you and I
are tempted to criticize someone tomorrow, let's remember Al
Capone, "Two Gun" Crowley and Albert Fall. Let's realize that
criticisms are like homing pigeons. They always return home. Let's
realize that the person we are going to correct and condemn will
probably justify himself or herself, and condemn us in return; or, like
the gentle Taft, will say: "I don't see how I could have done any
differently from what I have."
On the morning of April 15, 1865, Abraham Lincoln lay dying in a hall
bedroom of a cheap lodging house directly across the street from
Ford's Theater, where John Wilkes Booth had shot him. Lincoln's
long body lay stretched diagonally across a sagging bed that was too
short for him. A cheap reproduction of Rosa Bonheur's famous
painting The Horse Fair hung above the bed, and a dismal gas jet
flickered yellow light.
As Lincoln lay dying, Secretary of War Stanton said, "There lies the
most perfect ruler of men that the world has ever seen."
What was the secret of Lincoln's success in dealing with people? I
studied the life of Abraham Lincoln for ten years and devoted all of
three years to writing and rewriting a book entitled Lincoln the
Unknown. I believe I have made as detailed and exhaustive a study
of Lincoln's personality and home life as it is possible for any being to
make. I made a special study of Lincoln's method of dealing with
people. Did he indulge in criticism? Oh, yes. As a young man in the
Pigeon Creek Valley of Indiana, he not only criticized but he wrote
letters and poems ridiculing people and dropped these letters on the
country roads where they were sure to be found. One of these
letters aroused resentments that burned for a lifetime.
Even after Lincoln had become a practicing lawyer in Springfield,
Illinois, he attacked his opponents openly in letters published in the
newspapers. But he did this just once too often.
In the autumn of 1842 he ridiculed a vain, pugnacious politician by
the name of James Shields. Lincoln lamned him through an
anonymous letter published in Springfield Journal. The town roared
with laughter. Shields, sensitive and proud, boiled with indignation.
He found out who wrote the letter, leaped on his horse, started after
Lincoln, and challenged him to fight a duel. Lincoln didn't want to
fight. He was opposed to dueling, but he couldn't get out of it and
save his honor. He was given the choice of weapons. Since he had
very long arms, he chose cavalry broadswords and took lessons in
sword fighting from a West Point graduate; and, on the appointed
day, he and Shields met on a sandbar in the Mississippi River,
prepared to fight to the death; but, at the last minute, their seconds
interrupted and stopped the duel.
That was the most lurid personal incident in Lincoln's life. It taught
him an invaluable lesson in the art of dealing with people. Never
again did he write an insulting letter. Never again did he ridicule
anyone. And from that time on, he almost never criticized anybody
for anything.
Time after time, during the Civil War, Lincoln put a new general at
the head of the Army of the Potomac, and each one in turn -
McClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker, Meade - blundered tragically and
drove Lincoln to pacing the floor in despair. Half the nation savagely
condemned these incompetent generals, but Lincoln, "with malice
toward none, with charity for all," held his peace. One of his favorite
quotations was "Judge not, that ye be not judged."
And when Mrs. Lincoln and others spoke harshly of the southern
people, Lincoln replied: "Don't criticize them; they are just what we
would be under similar circumstances."
Yet if any man ever had occasion to criticize, surely it was Lincoln.
Let's take just one illustration:
The Battle of Gettysburg was fought during the first three days of
July 1863. During the night of July 4, Lee began to retreat southward
while storm clouds deluged the country with rain. When Lee reached
the Potomac with his defeated army, he found a swollen, impassable
river in front of him, and a victorious Union Army behind him. Lee
was in a trap. He couldn't escape. Lincoln saw that. Here was a
golden, heaven-sent opportunity-the opportunity to capture Lee's
army and end the war immediately. So, with a surge of high hope,
Lincoln ordered Meade not to call a council of war but to attack Lee
immediately. Lincoln telegraphed his orders and then sent a special
messenger to Meade demanding immediate action.
And what did General Meade do? He did the very opposite of what
he was told to do. He called a council of war in direct violation of
Lincoln's orders. He hesitated. He procrastinated. He telegraphed all
manner of excuses. He refused point-blank to attack Lee. Finally the
waters receded and Lee escaped over the Potomac with his forces.
Lincoln was furious, " What does this mean?" Lincoln cried to his son
Robert. "Great God! What does this mean? We had them within our
grasp, and had only to stretch forth our hands and they were ours;
yet nothing that I could say or do could make the army move. Under
the circumstances, almost any general could have defeated Lee. If I
had gone up there, I could have whipped him myself."
In bitter disappointment, Lincoln sat down and wrote Meade this
letter. And remember, at this period of his life Lincoln was extremely
conservative and restrained in his phraseology. So this letter coming
from Lincoln in 1863 was tantamount to the severest rebuke.
My dear General,
I do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune
involved in Lee's escape. He was within our easy grasp, and to have
closed upon him would, in connection With our other late successes,
have ended the war. As it is, the war will be prolonged indefinitely. If
you could not safely attack Lee last Monday, how can you possibly
do so south of the river, when you can take with you very few-no
more than two-thirds of the force you then had in hand? It would be
unreasonable to expect and I do not expect that you can now effect
much. Your golden opportunity is gone, and I am distressed
immeasurably because of it.
What do you suppose Meade did when he read the letter?
Meade never saw that letter. Lincoln never mailed it. It was found
among his papers after his death.
My guess is - and this is only a guess - that after writing that letter,
Lincoln looked out of the window and said to himself, "Just a minute.
Maybe I ought not to be so hasty. It is easy enough for me to sit
here in the quiet of the White House and order Meade to attack; but
if I had been up at Gettysburg, and if I had seen as much blood as
Meade has seen during the last week, and if my ears had been
pierced with the screams and shrieks of the wounded and dying,
maybe I wouldn't be so anxious to attack either. If I had Meade's
timid temperament, perhaps I would have done just what he had
done. Anyhow, it is water under the bridge now. If I send this letter,
it will relieve my feelings, but it will make Meade try to justify
himself. It will make him condemn me. It will arouse hard feelings,
impair all his further usefulness as a commander, and perhaps force
him to resign from the army."
So, as I have already said, Lincoln put the letter aside, for he had
learned by bitter experience that sharp criticisms and rebukes almost
invariably end in futility.
Theodore Roosevelt said that when he, as President, was confronted
with a perplexing problem, he used to lean back and look up at a
large painting of Lincoln which hung above his desk in the White
House and ask himself, "What would Lincoln do if he were in my
shoes? How would he solve this problem?"
The next time we are tempted to admonish somebody, /let's pull a
five-dollar bill out of our pocket, look at Lincoln's picture on the bill,
and ask. "How would Lincoln handle this problem if he had it?"
Mark Twain lost his temper occasionally and wrote letters that turned
the Paper brown. For example, he once wrote to a man who had
aroused his ire: "The thing for you is a burial permit. You have only
to speak and I will see that you get it." On another occasion he
wrote to an editor about a proofreader's attempts to "improve my
spelling and punctuation." He ordered: "Set the matter according to
my copy hereafter and see that the proofreader retains his
suggestions in the mush of his decayed brain."
The writing of these stinging letters made Mark Twain feel better.
They allowed him to blow off steam, and the letters didn't do any
real harm, because Mark's wife secretly lifted them out of the mail.
They were never sent.
Do you know someone you would like to change and regulate and
improve? Good! That is fine. I am all in favor of it, But why not begin
on yourself? From a purely selfish standpoint, that is a lot more
profitable than trying to improve others - yes, and a lot less
dangerous. "Don't complain about the snow on your neighbor's roof,"
said Confucius, "when your own doorstep is unclean."
When I was still young and trying hard to impress people, I wrote a
foolish letter to Richard Harding Davis, an author who once loomed
large on the literary horizon of America. I was preparing a magazine
article about authors, and I asked Davis to tell me about his method
of work. A few weeks earlier, I had received a letter from someone
with this notation at the bottom: "Dictated but not read." I was quite
impressed. I felt that the writer must be very big and busy and
important. I wasn't the slightest bit busy, but I was eager to make
an impression on Richard Harding Davis, so I ended my short note
with the words: "Dictated but not read."
He never troubled to answer the letter. He simply returned it to me
with this scribbled across the bottom: "Your bad manners are
exceeded only by your bad manners." True, I had blundered, and
perhaps I deserved this rebuke. But, being human, I resented it. I
resented it so sharply that when I read of the death of Richard
Harding Davis ten years later, the one thought that still persisted in
my mind - I am ashamed to admit - was the hurt he had given me.
If you and I want to stir up a resentment tomorrow that may rankle
across the decades and endure until death, just let us indulge in a
little stinging criticism-no matter how certain we are that it is
justified.
When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with
creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion,
creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.
Bitter criticism caused the sensitive Thomas Hardy, one of the finest
novelists ever to enrich English literature, to give up forever the
writing of fiction. Criticism drove Thomas Chatterton, the English
poet, to suicide.
Benjamin Franklin, tactless in his youth, became so diplomatic, so
adroit at handling people, that he was made American Ambassador
to France. The secret of his success? "I will speak ill of no man," he
said, " . . and speak all the good I know of everybody."
Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain - and most fools do.
But it takes character and self-control to be under-standing and
forgiving.
"A great man shows his greatness," said Carlyle, "by the way he
treats little men."
Bob Hoover, a famous test pilot and frequent per-former at air
shows, was returning to his home in Los Angeles from an air show in
San Diego. As described in the magazine Flight Operations, at three
hundred feet in the air, both engines suddenly stopped. By deft
maneuvering he managed to land the plane, but it was badly
damaged although nobody was hurt.
Hoover's first act after the emergency landing was to inspect the
airplane's fuel. Just as he suspected, the World War II propeller
plane he had been flying had been fueled with jet fuel rather than
gasoline.
Upon returning to the airport, he asked to see the mechanic who had
serviced his airplane. The young man was sick with the agony of his
mistake. Tears streamed down his face as Hoover approached. He
had just caused the loss of a very expensive plane and could have
caused the loss of three lives as well.
You can imagine Hoover's anger. One could anticipate the tonguelashing
that this proud and precise pilot would unleash for that
carelessness. But Hoover didn't scold the mechanic; he didn't even
criticize him. Instead, he put his big arm around the man's shoulder
and said, "To show you I'm sure that you'll never do this again, I
want you to service my F-51 tomorrow."
Often parents are tempted to criticize their children. You would
expect me to say "don't." But I will not, I am merely going to say,
"Before you criticize them, read one of the classics of American
journalism, 'Father Forgets.' " It originally appeared as an editorial in
the People's Home Journnl. We are reprinting it here with the
author's permission, as condensed in the Reader's Digest:
"Father Forgets" is one of those little pieces which-dashed of in a
moment of sincere feeling - strikes an echoing chord in so many
readers as to become a perenial reprint favorite. Since its first
appearance, "Father Forgets" has been reproduced, writes the
author, W, Livingston Larned, "in hundreds of magazines and house
organs, and in newspapers the country over. It has been reprinted
almost as extensively in many foreign languages. I have given
personal permission to thousands who wished to read it from school,
church, and lecture platforms. It has been 'on the air' on countless
occasions and programs. Oddly enough, college periodicals have
used it, and high-school magazines. Sometimes a little piece seems
mysteriously to 'click.' This one certainly did."
FATHER FORGETS W. Livingston Larned
Listen, son: I am saying this as you lie asleep, one little paw
crumpled under your cheek and the blond curls stickily wet on your
damp forehead. I have stolen into your room alone. Just a few
minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the library, a stifling wave
of remorse swept over me. Guiltily I came to your bedside.
There are the things I was thinking, son: I had been cross to you. I
scolded you as you were dressing for school because you gave your
face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to task for not cleaning
your shoes. I called out angrily when you threw some of your things
on the floor.
At breakfast I found fault, too. You spilled things. You gulped down
your food. You put your elbows on the table. You spread butter too
thick on your bread. And as you started off to play and I made for
my train, you turned and waved a hand and called, "Goodbye,
Daddy!" and I frowned, and said in reply, "Hold your shoulders
back!"
Then it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came up the
road I spied you, down on your knees, playing marbles. There were
holes in your stockings. I humiliated you before your boyfriends by
marching you ahead of me to the house. Stockings were expensive -
and if you had to
buy them you would be more careful! Imagine that, son, from a
father!
Do you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how you
came in timidly, with a sort of hurt look in your eyes? When I
glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you
hesitated at the door. "What is it you want?" I snapped.
You said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous plunge, and
threw your arms around my neck and kissed me, and your small
arms tightened with an affection that God had set blooming in your
heart and which even neglect could not wither. And then you were
gone, pattering up the stairs.
Well, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my
hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me. What has habit
been doing to me? The habit of finding fault, of reprimanding - this
was my reward to you for being a boy. It was not that I did not love
you; it was that I expected too much of youth. I was measuring you
by the yardstick of my own years.
And there was so much that was good and fine and true in your
character. The little heart of you was as big as the dawn itself over
the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous impulse to rush
in and kiss me good night. Nothing else matters tonight, son. I have
come to your bed-side in the darkness, and I have knelt there,
ashamed!
It is a feeble atonement; I know you would not understand these
things if I told them to you during your waking hours. But tomorrow
I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer when you
suffer, and laugh when you laugh. I will bite my tongue when
impatient words come. I will keep saying as if it were a ritual: "He is
nothing but a boy - a little boy!"
I am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you now,
son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that you are still a baby.
Yesterday you were in your mother's arms, your head on her
shoulder. I have asked too much, too much.
Instead of condemning people, let's try to understand them. Let's try
to figure out why they do what they do. That's a lot more profitable
and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and
kindness. "To know all is to forgive all."
As Dr. Johnson said: "God himself, sir, does not propose to judge
man until the end of his days."
Why should you and I?
? Principle 1 - Don't criticize, condemn or complain.

2 - The Big Secret Of Dealing With People
There is only one way under high heaven to get anybody to do
anything. Did you ever stop to think of that? Yes, just one way. And
that is by making the other person want to do it.
Remember, there is no other way.
Of course, you can make someone want to give you his watch by
sticking a revolver in his ribs. YOU can make your employees give
you cooperation - until your back is turned - by threatening to fire
them. You can make a child do what you want it to do by a whip or a
threat. But these crude methods have sharply undesirable
repercussions.
The only way I can get you to do anything is by giving you what you
want.
What do you want?
Sigmund Freud said that everything you and I do springs from two
motives: the sex urge and the desire to be great.
John Dewey, one of America's most profound philosophers, phrased
it a bit differently. Dr. Dewey said that the deepest urge in human
nature is "the desire to be important." Remember that phrase: "the
desire to be important." It is significant. You are going to hear a lot
about it in this book.
What do you want? Not many things, but the few that you do wish,
you crave with an insistence that will not be denied. Some of the
things most people want include:
1. Health and the preservation of life. 2. Food. 3. Sleep. 4. Money
and the things money will buy. 5. Life in the hereafter. 6. Sexual
gratification. 7. The well-being of our children. 8. A feeling of
importance.
Almost all these wants are usually gratified-all except one. But there
is one longing - almost as deep, almost as imperious, as the desire
for food or sleep - which is seldom gratified. It is what Freud calls
"the desire to be great." It is what Dewey calls the "desire to be
important."
Lincoln once began a letter saying: "Everybody likes a compliment."
William James said: "The deepest principle in human nature is the
craving to be appreciated." He didn't speak, mind you, of the "wish"
or the "desire" or the "longing" to be appreciated. He said the
"craving" to be appreciated.
Here is a gnawing and unfaltering human hunger, and the rare
individual who honestly satisfies this heart hunger will hold people in
the palm of his or her hand and "even the undertaker will be sorry
when he dies."
The desire for a feeling of importance is one of the chief
distinguishing differences between mankind and the animals. To
illustrate: When I was a farm boy out in Missouri, my father bred fine
Duroc-Jersey hogs and . pedigreed white - faced cattle. We used to
exhibit our hogs and white-faced cattle at the country fairs and livestock
shows throughout the Middle West. We won first prizes by the
score. My father pinned his blue ribbons on a sheet of white muslin,
and when friends or visitors came to the house, he would get out the
long sheet of muslin. He would hold one end and I would hold the
other while he exhibited the blue ribbons.
The hogs didn't care about the ribbons they had won. But Father did.
These prizes gave him a feeling of importance.
If our ancestors hadn't had this flaming urge for a feeling of
importance, civilization would have been impossible. Without it, we
should have been just about like animals.
It was this desire for a feeling of importance that led an uneducated,
poverty-stricken grocery clerk to study some law books he found in
the bottom of a barrel of household plunder that he had bought for
fifty cents. You have probably heard of this grocery clerk. His name
was Lincoln.
It was this desire for a feeling of importance that inspired Dickens to
write his immortal novels. This desire inspired Sir Christoper Wren to
design his symphonies in stone. This desire made Rockefeller amass
millions that he never spent! And this same desire made the richest
family in your town build a house far too large for its requirements.
This desire makes you want to wear the latest styles, drive the latest
cars, and talk about your brilliant children.
It is this desire that lures many boys and girls into joining gangs and
engaging in criminal activities. The average young criminal,
according to E. P. Mulrooney, onetime police commissioner of New
York, is filled with ego, and his first request after arrest is for those
lurid newspapers that make him out a hero. The disagreeable
prospect of serving time seems remote so long as he can gloat over
his likeness sharing space with pictures of sports figures, movie and
TV stars and politicians.
If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I'll tell you
what you are. That determines your character. That is the most
significant thing about you. For example, John D. Rockefeller got his
feeling of importance by giving money to erect a modern hospital in
Peking, China, to care for millions of poor people whom he had never
seen and never would see. Dillinger, on the other hand, got his
feeling of importance by being a bandit, a bank robber and killer.
When the FBI agents were hunting him, he dashed into a farmhouse
up in Minnesota and said, "I'm Dillinger!" He was proud of the fact
that he was Public Enemy Number One. "I'm not going to hurt you,
but I'm Dillinger!" he said.
Yes, the one significant difference between Dillinger and Rockefeller
is how they got their feeling of importance.
History sparkles with amusing examples of famous people struggling
for a feeling of importance. Even George Washington wanted to be
called "His Mightiness, the President of the United States"; and
Columbus pleaded for the title "Admiral of the Ocean and Viceroy of
India." Catherine the Great refused to open letters that were not
addressed to "Her Imperial Majesty"; and Mrs. Lincoln, in the White
House, turned upon Mrs. Grant like a tigress and shouted, "How dare
you be seated in my presence until I invite you!"
Our millionaires helped finance Admiral Byrd's expedition to the
Antarctic in 1928 with the understanding that ranges of icy
mountains would be named after them; and Victor Hugo aspired to
have nothing less than the city of Paris renamed in his honor. Even
Shakespeare, mightiest of the mighty, tried to add luster to his name
by procuring a coat of arms for his family.
People sometimes became invalids in order to win sympathy and
attention, and get a feeling of importance. For example, take Mrs.
McKinley. She got a feeling of importance by forcing her husband,
the President of the United States, to neglect important affairs of
state while he reclined on the bed beside her for hours at a time, his
arm about her, soothing her to sleep. She fed her gnawing desire for
attention by insisting that he remain with her while she was having
her teeth fixed, and once created a stormy scene when he had to
leave her alone with the dentist while he kept an appointment with
John Hay, his secretary of state.
The writer Mary Roberts Rinehart once told me of a bright, vigorous
young woman who became an invalid in order to get a feeling of
importance. "One day," said Mrs. Rinehart, "this woman had been
obliged to face something, her age perhaps. The lonely years were
stretching ahead and there was little left for her to anticipate.
"She took to her bed; and for ten years her old mother traveled to
the third floor and back, carrying trays, nursing her. Then one day
the old mother, weary with service, lay down and died. For some
weeks, the invalid languished; then she got up, put on her clothing,
and resumed living again."
Some authorities declare that people may actually go insane in order
to find, in the dreamland of insanity, the feeling of importance that
has been denied them in the harsh world of reality. There are more
patients suffering from mental diseases in the United States than
from all other diseases combined.
What is the cause of insanity?
Nobody can answer such a sweeping question, but we know that
certain diseases, such as syphilis, break down and destroy the brain
cells and result in insanity. In fact, about one-half of all mental
diseases can be attributed to such physical causes as brain lesions,
alcohol, toxins and injuries. But the other half - and this is the
appalling part of the story - the other half of the people who go
insane apparently have nothing organically wrong with their brain
cells. In post-mortem examinations, when their brain tissues are
studied under the highest-powered microscopes, these tissues are
found to be apparently just as healthy as yours and mine.
Why do these people go insane?
I put that question to the head physician of one of our most
important psychiatric hospitals. This doctor, who has received the
highest honors and the most coveted awards for his knowledge of
this subject, told me frankly that he didn't know why people went
insane. Nobody knows for sure But he did say that many people who
go insane find in insanity a feeling of importance that they were
unable to achieve in the world of reality. Then he told me this story:
"I have a patient right now whose marriage proved to be a tragedy.
She wanted love, sexual gratification, children and social prestige,
but life blasted all her hopes. Her husband didn't love her. He
refused even to eat with her and forced her to serve his meals in his
room upstairs. She had no children, no social standing. She went
insane; and, in her imagination, she divorced her husband and
resumed her maiden name. She now believes she has married into
English aristocracy, and she insists on being called Lady Smith.
"And as for children, she imagines now that she has had a new child
every night. Each time I call on her she says: 'Doctor, I had a baby
last night.' "
Life once wrecked all her dream ships on the sharp rocks of reality;
but in the sunny, fantasy isles of insanity, all her barkentines race
into port with canvas billowing and winds singing through the masts.
" Tragic? Oh, I don't know. Her physician said to me: If I could
stretch out my hand and restore her sanity, I wouldn't do it. She's
much happier as she is."
If some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance that they
actually go insane to get it, imagine what miracle you and I can
achieve by giving people honest appreciation this side of insanity.
One of the first people in American business to be paid a salary of
over a million dollars a year (when there was no income tax and a
person earning fifty dollars a week was considered well off) was
Charles Schwab, He had been picked by Andrew Carnegie to become
the first president of the newly formed United States Steel Company
in 1921, when Schwab was only thirty-eight years old. (Schwab later
left U.S. Steel to take over the then-troubled Bethlehem Steel
Company, and he rebuilt it into one of the most profitable companies
in America.)
Why did Andrew Carnegie pay a million dollars a year, or more than
three thousand dollars a day, to Charles Schwab? Why? Because
Schwab was a genius? No. Because he knew more about the
manufacture of steel than other people? Nonsense. Charles Schwab
told me himself that he had many men working for him who knew
more about the manufacture of steel than he did.
Schwab says that he was paid this salary largely because of his
ability to deal with people. I asked him how he did it. Here is his
secret set down in his own words - words that ought to be cast in
eternal bronze and hung in every home and school, every shop and
office in the land - words that children ought to memorize instead of
wasting their time memorizing the conjugation of Latin verbs or the
amount of the annual rainfall in Brazil - words that will all but
transform your life and mine if we will only live them:
"I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people," said
Schwab, "the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the
best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement.
"There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as
criticisms from superiors. I never criticize any-one. I believe in giving
a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to
find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish
in my praise. "
That is what Schwab did. But what do average people do? The exact
opposite. If they don't like a thing, they bawl out their subordinates;
if they do like it, they say nothing. As the old couplet says: "Once I
did bad and that I heard ever/Twice I did good, but that I heard
never."
"In my wide association in life, meeting with many and great people
in various parts of the world," Schwab declared, "I have yet to find
the person, however great or exalted his station, who did not do
better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval
than he would ever do under a spirit of criticism."
That he said, frankly, was one of the outstanding reasons for the
phenomenal success of Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie praised his
associates publicly as well as pr-vately.
Carnegie wanted to praise his assistants even on his tombstone. He
wrote an epitaph for himself which read: "Here lies one who knew
how to get around him men who were cleverer than himself:"
Sincere appreciation was one of the secrets of the first John D.
Rockefeller's success in handling men. For example, when one of his
partners, Edward T. Bedford, lost a million dollars for the firm by a
bad buy in South America, John D. might have criticized; but he
knew Bedford had done his best - and the incident was closed. So
Rockefeller found something to praise; he congratulated Bedford
because he had been able to save 60 percent of the money he had
invested. "That's splendid," said Rockefeller. "We don't always do as
well as that upstairs."
I have among my clippings a story that I know never happened, but
it illustrates a truth, so I'll repeat it:
According to this silly story, a farm woman, at the end of a heavy
day's work, set before her menfolks a heaping pile of hay. And when
they indignantly demanded whether she had gone crazy, she replied:
"Why, how did I know you'd notice? I've been cooking for you men
for the last twenty years and in all that time I ain't heard no word to
let me know you wasn't just eating hay."
When a study was made a few years ago on runaway wives, what do
you think was discovered to be the main reason wives ran away? It
was "lack of appreciation." And I'd bet that a similar study made of
runaway husbands would come out the same way. We often take our
spouses so much for granted that we never let them know we
appreciate them.
A member of one of our classes told of a request made by his wife.
She and a group of other women in her church were involved in a
self-improvement program. She asked her husband to help her by
listing six things he believed she could do to help her become a
better wife. He reported to the class: "I was surprised by such a
request. Frankly, it would have been easy for me to list six things I
would like to change about her - my heavens, she could have listed a
thousand things she would like to change about me - but I didn't. I
said to her, 'Let me think about it and give you an answer in the
morning.'
"The next morning I got up very early and called the florist and had
them send six red roses to my wife with a note saying: 'I can't think
of six things I would like to change about you. I love you the way
you are.'
"When I arrived at home that evening, who do you think greeted me
at the door: That's right. My wife! She was almost in tears. Needless
to say, I was extremely glad I had not criticized her as she had
requested.
"The following Sunday at church, after she had reported the results
of her assignment, several women with whom she had been studying
came up to me and said, 'That was the most considerate thing I
have ever heard.' It was then I realized the power of appreciation."
Florenz Ziegfeld, the most spectacular producer who ever dazzled
Broadway, gained his reputation by his subtle ability to "glorify the
American girl." Time after time, he took drab little creatures that no
one ever looked at twice and transformed them on the stage into
glamorous visions of mystery and seduction. Knowing the value of
appreciation and confidence, he made women feel beautiful by the
sheer power of his gallantry and consideration. He was practical: he
raised the salary of chorus girls from thirty dollars a week to as high
as one hundred and seventy-five. And he was also chivalrous; on
opening night at the Follies, he sent telegrams to the stars in the
cast, and he deluged every chorus girl in the show with American
Beauty roses.
I once succumbed to the fad of fasting and went for six days and
nights without eating. It wasn't difficult. I was less hungry at the end
of the sixth day than I was at the end of the second. Yet I know, as
you know, people who would think they had committed a crime if
they let their families or employees go for six days without food; but
they will let them go for six days, and six weeks, and sometimes
sixty years without giving them the hearty appreciation that they
crave almost as much as they crave food.
When Alfred Lunt, one of the great actors of his time, played the
leading role in Reunion in Vienna, he said, "There is nothing I need
so much as nourishment for my self-esteem."
We nourish the bodies of our children and friends and employees,
but how seldom do we nourish their selfesteem? We provide them
with roast beef and potatoes to build energy, but we neglect to give
them kind words of appreciation that would sing in their memories
for years like the music of the morning stars.
Paul Harvey, in one of his radio broadcasts, "The Rest of the Story,"
told how showing sincere appreciation can change a person's life. He
reported that years ago a teacher in Detroit asked Stevie Morris to
help her find a mouse that was lost in the classroom. You see, she
appreciated the fact that nature had given Stevie something no one
else in the room had. Nature had given Stevie a remarkable pair of
ears to compensate for his blind eyes. But this was really the first
time Stevie had been shown appreciation for those talented ears.
Now, years later, he says that this act of appreciation was the
beginning of a new life. You see, from that time on he developed his
gift of hearing and went on to become, under the stage name of
Stevie Wonder, one of the great pop singers and and songwriters of
the seventies.*

Some readers are saying right now as they read these lines: "Oh,
phooey! Flattery! Bear oil! I've tried that stuff. It doesn't work - not
with intelligent people."
Of course flattery seldom works with discerning people. It is shallow,
selfish and insincere. It ought to fail and it usually does. True, some
people are so hungry, so thirsty, for appreciation that they will
swallow anything, just as a starving man will eat grass and
fishworms.
Even Queen Victoria was susceptible to flattery. Prime Minister
Benjamin Disraeli confessed that he put it on thick in dealing with
the Queen. To use his exact words, he said he "spread it on with a
trowel." But Disraeli was one of the most polished, deft and adroit
men who ever ruled the far-flung British Empire. He was a genius in
his line. What would work for him wouldn't necessarily work for you
and me. In the long run, flattery will do you more harm than good.
Flattery is counterfeit, and like counterfeit money, it will eventually
get you into trouble if you pass it to someone else.
The difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simple.
One is sincere and the other insincere. One comes from the heart
out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other selfish.
One is universally admired; the other universally condemned.
I recently saw a bust of Mexican hero General Alvaro Obregon in the
Chapultepec palace in Mexico City. Below the bust are carved these
wise words from General Obregon's philosophy: "Don't be afraid of
enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you."
No! No! No! I am not suggesting flattery! Far from it. I'm talking
about a new way of life. Let me repeat. I am talking about a new
way of life.
King George V had a set of six maxims displayed on the walls of his
study at Buckingham Palace. One of these maxims said: "Teach me
neither to proffer nor receive cheap praise." That's all flattery is -
cheap praise. I once read a definition of flattery that may be worth
repeating: "Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he
thinks about himself."
"Use what language you will," said Ralph Waldo Emerson, "you can
never say anything but what you are ."
If all we had to do was flatter, everybody would catch on and we
should all be experts in human relations.
When we are not engaged in thinking about some definite problem,
we usually spend about 95 percent of our time thinking about
ourselves. Now, if we stop thinking about ourselves for a while and
begin to think of the other person's good points, we won't have to
resort to flattery so cheap and false that it can be spotted almost
before it is out of the mouth,
One of the most neglected virtues of our daily existence is
appreciation, Somehow, we neglect to praise our son or daughter
when he or she brings home a good report card, and we fail to
encourage our children when they first succeed in baking a cake or
building a birdhouse.
Nothing pleases children more than this kind of parental interest and
approval.
The next time you enjoy filet mignon at the club, send word to the
chef that it was excellently prepared, and when a tired salesperson
shows you unusual courtesy, please mention it.
Every minister, lecturer and public speaker knows the
discouragement of pouring himself or herself out to an audience and
not receiving a single ripple of appreciative comment. What applies
to professionals applies doubly to workers in offices, shops and
factories and our families and friends. In our interpersonal relations
we should never forget that all our associates are human beings and
hunger for appreciation. It is the legal tender that all souls enjoy.
Try leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude on your daily
trips. You will be surprised how they will set small flames of
friendship that will be rose beacons on your next visit.
Pamela Dunham of New Fairfield, Connecticut, had among her
responsibilities on her job the supervision of a janitor who was doing
a very poor job. The other employees would jeer at him and litter the
hallways to show him what a bad job he was doing. It was so bad,
productive time was being lost in the shop.
Without success, Pam tried various ways to motivate this person.
She noticed that occasionally he did a particularly good piece of
work. She made a point to praise him for it in front of the other
people. Each day the job he did all around got better, and pretty
soon he started doing all his work efficiently. Now he does an
excellent job and other people give him appreciation and recognition.
Honest appreciation got results where criticism and ridicule failed.
Hurting people not only does not change them, it is never called for.
There is an old saying that I have cut out and pasted on my mirror
where I cannot help but see it every day:
I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or
any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now.
Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.
Emerson said: "Every man I meet is my superior in some way, In
that, I learn of him."
If that was true of Emerson, isn't it likely to be a thousand times
more true of you and me? Let's cease thinking of our
accomplishments, our wants. Let's try to figure out the other
person's good points. Then forget flattery. Give honest, sincere
appreciation. Be "hearty in your approbation and lavish in your
praise," and people will cherish your words and treasure them and
repeat them over a lifetime - repeat them years after you have
forgotten them.
? Principle 2 Give honest and sincere appreciation.

3 - "He Who Can Do This Has The Whole World With Him. He Who
Cannot Walks A Lonely Way"
I often went fishing up in Maine during the summer. Personally I am
very fond of strawberries and cream, but I have found that for some
strange reason, fish prefer worms. So when I went fishing, I didn't
think about what I wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I
didn't bait the hook with strawberries and cream. Rather, I dangled a
worm or a grasshopper in front of the fish and said: "Wouldn't you
like to have that?"
Why not use the same common sense when fishing for people?
That is what Lloyd George, Great Britain's Prime Minister during
World War I, did. When someone asked him how he managed to
stay in power after the other wartime leaders - Wilson, Orlando and
Clemenceau - had been forgotten, he replied that if his staying on
top might be attributed to any one thing, it would be to his having
learned that it was necessary to bait the hook to suit the fish .
Why talk about what we want? That is childish. Absurd. Of course,
you are interested in what you want. You are eternally interested in
it. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are
interested in what we want.
So the only way cm earth to influence other people is to talk about
what they want and show them how to get it.
Remember that tomorrow when you are trying to get somebody to
do something. If, for example, you don't want your children to
smoke, don't preach at them, and don't talk about what you want;
but show them that cigarettes may keep them from making the
basketball team or winning the hundred-yard dash.
This is a good thing to remember regardless of whether you are
dealing with children or calves or chimpanzees. For example: one
day Ralph Waldo Emerson and his son tried to get a calf into the
barn. But they made the common mistake of thinking only of what
they wanted: Emerson pushed and his son pulled. But the calf was
doing just what they were doing; he was thinking only of what he
wanted; so he stiffened his legs and stubbornly refused to leave the
pasture. The Irish housemaid saw their predicament. She couldn't
write essays and books; but, on this occasion at least, she had more
horse sense, or calf sense, than Emerson had. She thought of what
the calf wanted; so she put her maternal finger in the calf's mouth
and let the calf suck her finger as she gently led him into the barn.
Every act you have ever performed since the day you were born was
performed because you wanted something. How about the time you
gave a large contribution to the Red Cross? Yes, that is no exception
to the rule. You gave the Red Cross the donation because you
wanted to lend a helping hand; you wanted to do a beautiful,
unselfish, divine act. " Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the
least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."
If you hadn't wanted that feeling more than you wanted your money,
you would not have made the contribution. Of course, you might
have made the contribution because you were ashamed to refuse or
because a customer asked you to do it. But one thing is certain. You
made the contribution because you wanted something.
Harry A, Overstreet in his illuminating book Influencing Human
Behavior said; "Action springs out of what we fundamentally desire
... and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be
persuaders, whether in business, in the home, in the school, in
politics, is: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who
can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a
lonely way."
Andrew Carnegie, the poverty-stricken Scotch lad who started to
work at two cents an hour and finally gave away $365 million,
learned early in life that the only way to influence people is to talk in
terms of what the other person wants. He attended school only four
years; yet he learned how to handle people.
To illustrate: His sister-in-law was worried sick over her two boys.
They were at Yale, and they were so busy with their own affairs that
they neglected to write home and paid no attention whatever to their
mother's frantic letters.
Then Carnegie offered to wager a hundred dollars that he could get
an answer by return mail, without even asking for it. Someone called
his bet; so he wrote his nephews a chatty letter, mentioning casually
in a post-script that he was sending each one a five-dollar bill.
He neglected, however, to enclose the money.
Back came replies by return mail thanking "Dear Uncle Andrew" for
his kind note and-you can finish the sentence yourself.
Another example of persuading comes from Stan Novak of Cleveland,
Ohio, a participant in our course. Stan came home from work one
evening to find his youngest son, Tim, kicking and screaming on the
living room floor. He was to start kindergarten the next day and was
protesting that he would not go. Stan's normal reaction would have
been to banish the child to his room and tell him he'd just better
make up his mind to go. He had no choice. But tonight, recognizing
that this would not really help Tim start kindergarten in the best
frame of mind, Stan sat down and thought, "If I were Tim, why
would I be excited about going to kindergarten?" He and his wife
made a list of all the fun things Tim would do such as finger painting,
singing songs, making new friends. Then they put them into action.
"We all started finger-painting on the kitchen table-my wife, Lil, my
other son Bob, and myself, all having fun. Soon Tim was peeping
around the corner. Next he was begging to participate. 'Oh, no! You
have to go to kindergarten first to learn how to finger-paint.' With all
the enthusiasm I could muster I went through the list talking in
terms he could understand-telling him all the fun he would have in
kindergarten. The next morning, I thought I was the first one up. I
went downstairs and found Tim sitting sound asleep in the living
room chair. 'What are you doing here?' I asked. 'I'm waiting to go to
kindergarten. I don't want to be late.' The enthusiasm of our entire
family had aroused in Tim an eager want that no amount of
discussion or threat could have possibly accomplished."
Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something.
Before you speak, pause and ask yourself: "How can I make this
person want to do it?"
That question will stop us from rushing into a situation heedlessly,
with futile chatter about our desires.
At one time I rented the grand ballroom of a certain New York hotel
for twenty nights in each season in order to hold a series of lectures.
At the beginning of one season, I was suddenly informed that I
should have to pay almost three times as much rent as formerly.
This news reached me after the tickets had been printed and
distributed and all announcements had been made.
Naturally, I didn't want to pay the increase, but what was the use of
talking to the hotel about what I wanted? They were interested only
in what they wanted. So a couple of days later I went to see the
manager.
"I was a bit shocked when I got your letter," I said, "but I don't
blame you at all. If I had been in your position, I should probably
have written a similar letter myself. Your duty as the manager of the
hotel is to make all the profit possible. If you don't do that, you will
be fired and you ought to be fired. Now, let's take a piece of paper
and write down the advantages and the disadvantages that will
accrue to you, if you insist on this increase in rent."
Then I took a letterhead and ran a line through the center and
headed one column "Advantages" and the other column
"Disadvantages."
I wrote down under the head "Advantages" these words: "Ballroom
free." Then I went on to say: "You will have the advantage of having
the ballroom free to rent for dances and conventions. That is a big
advantage, for affairs like that will pay you much more than you can
get for a series of lectures. If I tie your ballroom up for twenty nights
during the course of the season, it is sure to mean a loss of some
very profitable business to you.
"Now, let's 'consider the disadvantages. First, instead of increasing
your income from me, you are going to decrease it. In fact, you are
going to wipe it out because I cannot pay the rent you are asking. I
shall be forced to hold these lectures at some other place.
"There's another disadvantage to you also. These lectures attract
crowds of educated and cultured people to your hotel. That is good
advertising for you, isn't it? In fact, if you spent five thousand dollars
advertising in the newspapers, you couldn't bring as many people to
look at your hotel as I can bring by these lectures. That is worth a lot
to a hotel, isn't it?"
As I talked, I wrote these two "disadvantages" under the proper
heading, and handed the sheet of paper to the manager, saying: "I
wish you would carefully consider both the advantages and
disadvantages that are going to accrue to you and then give me your
final decision."
I received a letter the next day, informing me that my rent would be
increased only 50 percent instead of 300 percent.
Mind you, I got this reduction without saying a word about what I
wanted. I talked all the time about what the other person wanted
and how he could get it.
Suppose I had done the human, natural thing; suppose I had
stormed into his office and said, "What do you mean by raising my
rent three hundred percent when you know the tickets have been
printed and the announcements made? Three hundred percent!
Ridiculous! Absurd! I won't pay it!"
What would have happened then? An argument would have begun
to steam and boil and sputter - and you know how arguments end.
Even if I had convinced him that he was wrong, his pride would have
made it difficult for him to back down and give in.
Here is one of the best bits of advice ever given about the fine art of
human relationships. "If there is any one secret of success," said
Henry Ford, "it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of
view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your
own."
That is so good, I want to repeat it: "If there is any one secret of
success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view
and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own."
That is so simple, so obvious, that anyone ought to see the truth of it
at a glance; yet 90 percent of the people on this earth ignore it 90
percent of the time.
An example? Look at the letters that come across your desk
tomorrow morning, and you will find that most of them violate this
important canon of common sense. Take this one, a letter written by
the head of the radio department of an advertising agency with
offices scattered across the continent. This letter was sent to the
managers of local radio stations throughout the country. (I have set
down, in brackets, my reactions to each paragraph.)
Mr. John Blank, Blankville, Indiana
Dear Mr. Blank: The ------ company desires to retain its position in
advertising agency leadership in the radio field.
[Who cares what your company desires? I am worried about my own
problems. The bank is foreclosing the mortage on my house, the
bugs are destroying the hollyhocks, the stock market tumbled
yesterday. I missed the eight-fifteen this morning, I wasn't invited to
the Jones's dance last night, the doctor tells me I have high blood
pressure and neuritis and dandruff. And then what happens? I come
down to the office this morning worried, open my mail and here is
some little whippersnapper off in New York yapping about what his
company wants. Bah! If he only realized what sort of impression his
letter makes, he would get out of the advertising business and start
manufacturing sheep dip.]
This agency's national advertising accounts were the bulwark of the
network. Our subsequent clearances of station time have kept us at
the top of agencies year after year.
[You are big and rich and right at the top, are you? So what? I don't
give two whoops in Hades if you are as big as General Motors and
General Electric and the General Staff of the U.S. Army all combined.
If you had as much sense as a half-witted hummingbird, you would
realize that I am interested in how big I am - not how big you are.
All this talk about your enormous success makes me feel small and
unimportant.]
We desire to service our accounts with the last word on radio station
information.
[You desire! You desire. You unmitigated ass. I'm not interested in
what you desire or what the President of the United States desires.
Let me tell you once and for all that I am interested in what I desire
- and you haven't said a word about that yet in this absurd letter of
yours .]
Will you, therefore, put the ---------- company on your preferred list
for weekly station information - every single detail that will be useful
to an agency in intelligently booking time.
["Preferred list." You have your nerve! You make me feel
insignificant by your big talk about your company - nd then you ask
me to put you on a "preferred" list, and you don't even say "please"
when you ask it.]
A prompt acknowledgment of this letter, giving us your latest
"doings," will be mutually helpful.
[You fool! You mail me a cheap form letter - a letter scattered far
and wide like the autumn leaves - and you have the gall to ask me,
when I am worried about the mortgage and the hollyhocks and my
blood pressure, to sit down and dictate a personal note
acknowledging your form letter - and you ask me to do it "promptly."
What do you mean, "promptly".? Don't you know I am just as busy
as you are - or, at least, I like to think I am. And while we are on the
subject, who gave you the lordly right to order me around? ... You
say it will be "mutually helpful." At last, at last, you have begun to
see my viewpoint. But you are vague about how it will be to my
advantage.]
Very truly yours, John Doe Manager Radio Department
P.S. The enclosed reprint from the Blankville Journal will be of
interest to you, and you may want to broadcast it over your station.
[Finally, down here in the postscript, you mention something that
may help me solve one of my problems. Why didn't you begin your
letter with - but what's the use? Any advertising man who is guilty of
perpetrating such drivel as you have sent me has something wrong
with his medulla oblongata. You don't need a letter giving our latest
doings. What you need is a quart of iodine in your thyroid gland.]
Now, if people who devote their lives to advertising and who pose as
experts in the art of influencing people to buy - if they write a letter
like that, what can we expect from the butcher and baker or the auto
mechanic?
Here is another letter, written by the superintendent of a large
freight terminal to a student of this course, Edward Vermylen. What
effect did this letter have on the man to whom it was addressed?
Read it and then I'll tell you.
A. Zerega's Sons, Inc. 28 Front St. Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201 Attention:
Mr. Edward Vermylen Gentlemen:
The operations at our outbound-rail-receiving station are
handicapped because a material percentage of the total business is
delivered us in the late afternoon. This condition results in
congestion, overtime on the part of our forces, delays to trucks, and
in some cases delays to freight. On November 10, we received from
your company a lot of 510 pieces, which reached here at 4:20 P.M.
We solicit your cooperation toward overcoming the undesirable
effects arising from late receipt of freight. May we ask that, on days
on which you ship the volume which was received on the above
date, effort be made either to get the truck here earlier or to deliver
us part of the freight during the morning?
The advantage that would accrue to you under such an arrangement
would be that of more expeditious discharge of your trucks and the
assurance that your business would go forward on the date of its
receipt.
Very truly yours, J----- B ----- Supt.
After reading this letter, Mr. Vermylen, sales manager for A. Zerega's
Sons, Inc., sent it to me with the following comment:
This letter had the reverse effect from that which was intended. The
letter begins by describing the Terminal's difficulties, in which we are
not interested, generally speaking. Our cooperation is then requested
without any thought as to whether it would inconvenience us, and
then, finally, in the last paragraph, the fact is mentioned that if we
do cooperate it will mean more expeditious discharge of our trucks
with the assurance that our freight will go forward on the date of its
receipt.
In other words, that in which we are most interested is mentioned
last and the whole effect is one of raising a spirit of antagonism
rather than of cooperation.
Let's see if we can't rewrite and improve this letter. Let's not waste
any time talking about our problems. As Henry Ford admonishes,
let's "get the other person's point of view and see things from his or
her angle, as well as from our own."
Here is one way of revising the letter. It may not be the best way,
but isn't it an improvement?
Mr. Edward Vermylen % A. Zerega's Sons, Inc. 28 Front St.
Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201
Dear Mr. Vermylen:
Your company has been one of our good customers for fourteen
years. Naturally, we are very grateful for your patronage and are
eager to give you the speedy, efficient service you deserve.
However, we regret to say that it isn't possible for us to do that
when your trucks bring us a large shipment late in the afternoon, as
they did on November 10. Why? Because many other customers
make late afternoon deliveries also. Naturally, that causes
congestion. That means your trucks are held up unavoidably at the
pier and sometimes even your freight is delayed.
That's bad, but it can be avoided. If you make your deliveries at the
pier in the morning when possible, your trucks will be able to keep
moving, your freight will get immediate attention, and our workers
will get home early at night to enjoy a dinner of the delicious
macaroni and noodles that you manufacture.
Regardless of when your shipments arrive, we shall always cheerfully
do all in our power to serve you promptly. You are busy. Please don't
trouble to answer this note.
Yours truly, J----- B-----, supt.
Barbara Anderson, who worked in a bank in New York, desired to
move to Phoenix, Arizona, because of the health of her son. Using
the principles she had learned in our course, she wrote the following
letter to twelve banks in Phoenix:
Dear Sir:
My ten years of bank experience should be of interest to a rapidly
growing bank like yours.
In various capacities in bank operations with the Bankers Trust
Company in New York, leading to my present assignment as Branch
Manager, I have acquired skills in all phases of banking including
depositor relations, credits, loans and administration.
I will be relocating to Phoenix in May and I am sure I can contribute
to your growth and profit. I will be in Phoenix the week of April 3
and would appreciate the opportunity to show you how I can help
your bank meet its goals.
Sincerely, Barbara L. Anderson
Do you think Mrs. Anderson received any response from that letter?
Eleven of the twelve banks invited her to be interviewed, and she
had a choice of which bank's offer to accept. Why? Mrs. Anderson
did not state what she wanted, but wrote in the letter how she could
help them, and focused on their wants, not her own.
Thousands of salespeople are pounding the pavements today, tired,
discouraged and underpaid. Why? Because they are always thinking
only of what they want. They don't realize that neither you nor I
want to buy anything. If we did, we would go out and buy it. But
both of us are eternally interested in solving our problems. And if
salespeople can show us how their services or merchandise will help
us solve our problems, they won't need to sell us. We'll buy. And
customers like to feel that they are buying - not being sold.
Yet many salespeople spend a lifetime in selling without seeing
things from the customer's angle. For example, for many years I
lived in Forest Hills, a little community of private homes in the center
of Greater New York. One day as I was rushing to the station, I
chanced to meet a real-estate operator who had bought and sold
property in that area for many years. He knew Forest Hills well, so I
hurriedly asked him whether or not my stucco house was built with
metal lath or hollow tile. He said he didn't know and told me what I
already knew - that I could find out by calling the Forest Hills Garden
Association. The following morning, I received a letter from him. Did
he give me the information I wanted? He could have gotten it in
sixty seconds by a telephone call. But he didn't. He told me again
that I could get it by telephoning, and then asked me to let him
handle my insurance.
He was not interested in helping me. He was interested only in
helping himself.
J. Howard Lucas of Birmingham, Alabama, tells how two salespeople
from the same company handled the same type of situation, He
reported:
"Several years ago I was on the management team of a small
company. Headquartered near us was the district office of a large
insurance company. Their agents were assigned territories, and our
company was assigned to two agents, whom I shall refer to as Carl
and John.
"One morning, Carl dropped by our office and casually mentioned
that his company had just introduced a new life insurance policy for
executives and thought we might be interested later on and he
would get back to us when he had more information on it.
"The same day, John saw us on the sidewalk while returning from a
coffee break, and he shouted: 'Hey Luke, hold up, I have some great
news for you fellows.' He hurried over and very excitedly told us
about an executive life insurance policy his company had introduced
that very day. (It was the same policy that Carl had casually
mentioned.) He wanted us to have one of the first issued. He gave
us a few important facts about the coverage and ended saying, 'The
policy is so new, I'm going to have someone from the home office
come out tomorrow and explain it. Now, in the meantime, let's get
the applications signed and on the way so he can have more
information to work with.' His enthusiasm aroused in us an eager
want for this policy even though we still did not have details, When
they were made available to us, they confirmed John's initial
understanding of the policy, and he not only sold each of us a policy,
but later doubled our coverage.
"Carl could have had those sales, but he made no effort to arouse in
us any desire for the policies."
The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the
rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous
advantage. He has little competition. Owen D. Young, a noted lawyer
and one of America's great business leaders, once said: "People who
can put themselves in the place of other people who can understand
the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future
has in store for them."
If out of reading this book you get just one thing - an increased
tendency to think always in terms of other people's point of view,
and see things from their angle - if you get that one thing out of this
book, it may easily prove to be one of the building blocks of your
career.
Looking at the other person's point of view and arousing in him an
eager want for something is not to be construed as manipulating
that person so that he will do something that is only for your benefit
and his detriment. Each party should gain from the negotiation. In
the letters to Mr. Vermylen, both the sender and the receiver of the
correspondence gained by implementing what was suggested. Both
the bank and Mrs. Anderson won by her letter in that the bank
obtained a valuable employee and Mrs. Anderson a suitable job. And
in the example of John's sale of insurance to Mr. Lucas, both gained
through this transaction.
Another example in which everybody gains through this principle of
arousing an eager want comes from Michael E. Whidden of Warwick,
Rhode Island, who is a territory salesman for the Shell Oil Company.
Mike wanted to become the Number One salesperson in his district,
but one service station was holding him back. It was run by an older
man who could not be motivated to clean up his station. It was in
such poor shape that sales were declining significantly.
This manager would not listen to any of Mike's pleas to upgrade the
station. After many exhortations and heart-to-heart talks - all of
which had no impact - Mike decided to invite the manager to visit the
newest Shell station in his territory.
The manager was so impressed by the facilities at the new station
that when Mike visited him the next time, his station was cleaned up
and had recorded a sales increase. This enabled Mike to reach the
Number One spot in his district. All his talking and discussion hadn't
helped, but by arousing an eager want in the manager, by showing
him the modern station, he had accomplished his goal, and both the
manager and Mike benefited.
Most people go through college and learn to read Virgil and master
the mysteries of calculus without ever discovering how their own
minds function. For instance: I once gave a course in Effective
Speaking for the young college graduates who were entering the
employ of the Carrier Corporation, the large air-conditioner
manufacturer. One of the participants wanted to persuade the others
to play basketball in their free time, and this is about what he said:
"I want you to come out and play basketball. I like to play basketball,
but the last few times I've been to the gymnasium there haven't
been enough people to get up a game. Two or three of us got to
throwing the ball around the other night - and I got a black eye. I
wish all of you would come down tomorrow night. I want to play
basketball."
Did he talk about anything you want? You don't want to go to a
gymnasium that no one else goes to, do you? You don't care about
what he wants. You don't want to get a black eye.
Could he have shown you how to get the things you want by using
the gymnasium? Surely. More pep. Keener edge to the appetite.
Clearer brain. Fun. Games. Basketball.
To repeat Professor Overstreet's wise advice: First, arouse in the
other person an eager want He who can do this has the whole world
with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.
One of the students in the author's training course was worried
about his little boy. The child was underweight and refused to eat
properly. His parents used the usual method. They scolded and
nagged. "Mother wants you to eat this and that." "Father wants you
to grow up to be a big man."
Did the boy pay any attention to these pleas? Just about as much as
you pay to one fleck of sand on a sandy beach.
No one with a trace of horse sense would expect a child three years
old to react to the viewpoint of a father thirty years old. Yet that was
precisely what that father had expected. It was absurd. He finally
saw that. So he said to himself: "What does that boy want? How can
I tie up what I want to what he wants?"
It was easy for the father when he starting thinking about it. His boy
had a tricycle that he loved to ride up and down the sidewalk in front
of the house in Brooklyn. A few doors down the street lived a bully -
a bigger boy who would pull the little boy off his tricycle and ride it
himself.
Naturally, the little boy would run screaming to his mother, and she
would have to come out and take the bully off the tricycle and put
her little boy on again, This happened almost every day.
What did the little boy want? It didn't take a Sherlock Holmes to
answer that one. His pride, his anger, his desire for a feeling of
importance - all the strongest emotions in his makeup - goaded him
to get revenge, to smash the bully in the nose. And when his father
explained that the boy would be able to wallop the daylights out of
the bigger kid someday if he would only eat the things his mother
wanted him to eat - when his father promised him that - there was
no longer any problem of dietetics. That boy would have eaten
spinach, sauerkraut, salt mackerel - anything in order to be big
enough to whip the bully who had humiliated him so often.
After solving that problem, the parents tackled another: the little boy
had the unholy habit of wetting his bed.
He slept with his grandmother. In the morning, his grandmother
would wake up and feel the sheet and say: "Look, Johnny, what you
did again last night."
He would say: "No, I didn't do it. You did it."
Scolding, spanking, shaming him, reiterating that the parents didn't
want him to do it - none of these things kept the bed dry. So the
parents asked: "How can we make this boy want to stop wetting his
bed?"
What were his wants? First, he wanted to wear pajamas like Daddy
instead of wearing a nightgown like Grandmother. Grandmother was
getting fed up with his nocturnal iniquities, so she gladly offered to
buy him a pair of pajamas if he would reform. Second, he wanted a
bed of his own. Grandma didn't object.
His mother took him to a department store in Brooklyn, winked at
the salesgirl, and said: "Here is a little gentleman who would like to
do some shopping."
The salesgirl made him feel important by saying: "Young man, what
can I show you?"
He stood a couple of inches taller and said: "I want to buy a bed for
myself."
When he was shown the one his mother wanted him to buy, she
winked at the salesgirl and the boy was persuaded to buy it.
The bed was delivered the next day; and that night, when Father
came home, the little boy ran to the door shouting: "Daddy! Daddy!
Come upstairs and see my bed that I bought!"
The father, looking at the bed, obeyed Charles Schwab's injunction:
he was "hearty in his approbation and lavish in his praise."
"You are not going to wet this bed, are you?" the father said. " Oh,
no, no! I am not going to wet this bed." The boy kept his promise,
for his pride was involved. That was his bed. He and he alone had
bought it. And he was wearing pajamas now like a little man. He
wanted to act like a man. And he did.
Another father, K.T. Dutschmann, a telephone engineer, a student of
this course, couldn't get his three-year old daughter to eat breakfast
food. The usual scolding, pleading, coaxing methods had all ended in
futility. So the parents asked themselves: "How can we make her
want to do it?"
The little girl loved to imitate her mother, to feel big and grown up;
so one morning they put her on a chair and let her make the
breakfast food. At just the psychological moment, Father drifted into
the kitchen while she was stirring the cereal and she said: "Oh, look,
Daddy, I am making the cereal this morning."
She ate two helpings of the cereal without any coaxing, because she
was interested in it. She had achieved a feeling of importance; she
had found in making the cereal an avenue of self-expression.
William Winter once remarked that "self-expression is the dominant
necessity of human nature." Why can't we adapt this same
psychology to business dealings? When we have a brilliant idea,
instead of making others think it is ours, why not let them cook and
stir the idea themselves. They will then regard it as their own; they
will like it and maybe eat a couple of helpings of it.

Part Two - Ways To Make People Like You
1 Do This And You'll Be Welcome Anywhere
Why read this book to find out how to win friends? Why not study
the technique of the greatest winner of friends the world has ever
known? Who is he? You may meet him tomorrow coming down the
street. When you get within ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his
tail. If you stop and pat him, he will almost jump out of his skin to
show you how much he likes you. And you know that behind this
show of affection on his part, there are no ulterior motives: he
doesn't want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn't want to
marry you.
Did you ever stop to think that a dog is the only animal that doesn't
have to work for a living? A hen has to lay eggs, a cow has to give
milk, and a canary has to sing. But a dog makes his living by giving
you nothing but love.
When I was five years old, my father bought a little yellow-haired
pup for fifty cents. He was the light and joy of my childhood. Every
afternoon about four-thirty, he would sit in the front yard with his
beautiful eyes staring steadfastly at the path, and as soon as he
heard my voice or saw me swinging my dinner pail through the buck
brush, he was off like a shot, racing breathlessly up the hill to greet
me with leaps of joy and barks of sheer ecstasy.
Tippy was my constant companion for five years. Then one tragic
night - I shall never forget it - he was killed within ten feet of my
head, killed by lightning. Tippy's death was the tragedy of my
boyhood.
You never read a book on psychology, Tippy. You didn't need to. You
knew by some divine instinct that you can make more friends in two
months by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you
can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you. Let
me repeat that. You can make more friends in two months by
becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by
trying to get other people interested in you.
Yet I know and you know people who blunder through life trying to
wigwag other people into becoming interested in them.
Of course, it doesn't work. People are not interested in you. They are
not interested in me. They are interested in themselves - morning,
noon and after dinner.
The New York Telephone Company made a detailed study of
telephone conversations to find out which word is the most
frequently used. You have guessed it: it is the personal pronoun "I."
"I." I." It was used 3,900 times in 500 telephone conversations. "I."
"I." "I." "I." When you see a group photograph that you are in,
whose picture do you look for first?
If we merely try to impress people and get people interested in us,
we will never have many true, sincere friends. Friends, real friends,
are not made that way.
Napoleon tried it, and in his last meeting with Josephine he said:
"Josephine, I have been as fortunate as any man ever was on this
earth; and yet, at this hour, you are the only person in the world on
whom I can rely." And historians doubt whether he could rely even
on her.
Alfred Adler, the famous Viennese psychologist, wrote a book
entitled What Life Should Mean to You. In that book he says: "It is
the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the
greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others.
It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring."
You may read scores of erudite tomes on psychology without coming
across a statement more significant for you and for me. Adler's
statement is so rich with meaning that I am going to repeat it in
italics:
It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has
the greatest difjculties in life and provides the greutest injury to
others. It is from umong such individuals that all humun failures
spring.
I once took a course in short-story writing at New York University,
and during that course the editor of a leading magazine talked to our
class. He said he could pick up any one of the dozens of stories that
drifted across his desk every day and after reading a few paragraphs
he could feel whether or not the author liked people. "If the author
doesn't like people," he said, "people won't like his or her stories."
This hard-boiled editor stopped twice in the course of his talk on
fiction writing and apologized for preaching a sermon. "I am telling
you," he said, "the same things your preacher would tell you, but
remember, you have to be interested in people if you want to be a
successful writer of stories."
If that is true of writing fiction, you can be sure it is true of dealing
with people face-to-face.
I spent an evening in the dressing room of Howard Thurston the last
time he appeared on Broadway -Thurston was the acknowledged
dean of magicians. For forty years he had traveled all over the world,
time and again, creating illusions, mystifying audiences, and making
people gasp with astonishment. More than 60 million people had
paid admission to his show, and he had made almost $2 million in
profit.
I asked Mr. Thurston to tell me the secret of his success. His
schooling certainly had nothing to do with it, for he ran away from
home as a small boy, became a hobo, rode in boxcars, slept in
haystacks, begged his food from door to door, and learned to read
by looking out of boxcars at signs along the railway.
Did he have a superior knowledge of magic? No, he told me
hundreds of books had been written about legerdemain and scores
of people knew as much about it as he did. But he had two things
that the others didn't have. First, he had the ability to put his
personality across the footlights. He was a master showman. He
knew human nature. Everything he did, every gesture, every
intonation of his voice, every lifting of an eyebrow had been carefully
rehearsed in advance, and his actions were timed to split seconds.
But, in addition to that, Thurston had a genuine interest in people.
He told me that many magicians would look at the audience and say
to themselves, "Well, there is a bunch of suckers out there, a bunch
of hicks; I'll fool them all right." But Thurston's method was totally
different. He told me that every time he went on stage he said to
himself: "I am grateful because these people come to see me, They
make it possible for me to make my living in a very agreeable way.
I'm going to give them the very best I possibly can."
He declared he never stepped in front of the footlights without first
saying to himself over and over: "I love my audience. I love my
audience." Ridiculous? Absurd? You are privileged to think anything
you like. I am merely passing it on to you without comment as a
recipe used by one of the most famous magicians of all time.
George Dyke of North Warren, Pennsylvania, was forced to retire
from his service station business after thirty years when a new
highway was constructed over the site of his station. It wasn't long
before the idle days of retirement began to bore him, so he started
filling in his time trying to play music on his old fiddle. Soon he was
traveling the area to listen to music and talk with many of the
accomplished fiddlers. In his humble and friendly way he became
generally interested in learning the background and interests of
every musician he met. Although he was not a great fiddler himself,
he made many friends in this pursuit. He attended competitions and
soon became known to the country music fans in the eastern part of
the United States as "Uncle George, the Fiddle Scraper from Kinzua
County." When we heard Uncle George, he was seventy-two and
enjoying every minute of his life. By having a sustained interest in
other people, he created a new life for himself at a time when most
people consider their productive years over.
That, too, was one of the secrets of Theodore Roosevelt's
astonishing popularity. Even his servants loved him. His valet, James
E. Amos, wrote a book about him entitled Theodore Roosevelt, Hero
to His Valet. In that book Amos relates this illuminating incident:
My wife one time asked the President about a bobwhite. She had
never seen one and he described it to her fully. Sometime later, the
telephone at our cottage rang. [Amos and his wife lived in a little
cottage on the Roosevelt estate at Oyster Bay.] My wife answered it
and it was Mr. Roosevelt himself. He had called her, he said, to tell
her that there was a bobwhite outside her window and that if she
would look out she might see it. Little things like that were so
characteristic of him. Whenever he went by our cottage, even
though we were out of sight, we would hear him call out: "Oo-oo-oo,
Annie?" or "Oo-oo-oo, James!" It was just a friendly greeting as he
went by.
How could employees keep from liking a man like that? How could
anyone keep from liking him? Roosevelt called at the White House
one day when the President and Mrs. Taft were away. His honest
liking for humble people was shown by the fact that he greeted all
the old White House servants by name, even the scullery maids.
"When he saw Alice, the kitchen maid," writes Archie Butt, "he asked
her if she still made corn bread. Alice told him that she sometimes
made it for the servants, but no one ate it upstairs.
"'They show bad taste,' Roosevelt boomed, 'and I'll tell the President
so when I see him.'
"Alice brought a piece to him on a plate, and he went over to the
office eating it as he went and greeting gardeners and laborers as he
passed. . .
"He addressed each person just as he had addressed them in the
past. Ike Hoover, who had been head usher at the White House for
forty years, said with tears in his eyes: 'It is the only happy day we
had in nearly two years, and not one of us would exchange it for a
hundred-dollar bill.' "
The same concern for the seemingly unimportant people helped
sales representative Edward M. Sykes, Jr., of Chatham, New Jersey,
retain an account. "Many years ago," he reported, "I called on
customers for Johnson and Johnson in the Massachusetts area. One
account was a drug store in Hingham. Whenever I went into this
store I would always talk to the soda clerk and sales clerk for a few
minutes before talking to the owner to obtain his order. One day I
went up to the owner of the store, and he told me to leave as he
was not interested in buying J&J products anymore because he felt
they were concentrating their activities on food and discount stores
to the detriment of the small drugstore. I left with my tail between
my legs and drove around the town for several hours. Finally, I
decided to go back and try at least to explain our position to the
owner of the store.
"When I returned I walked in and as usual said hello to the soda
clerk and sales clerk. When I walked up to the owner, he smiled at
me and welcomed me back. He then gave me double the usual
order, I looked at him with surprise and asked him what had
happened since my visit only a few hours earlier. He pointed to the
young man at the soda fountain and said that after I had left, the
boy had come over and said that I was one of the few salespeople
that called on the store that even bothered to say hello to him and to
the others in the store. He told the owner that if any salesperson
deserved his business, it was I. The owner agreed and remained a
loyal customer. I never forgot that to be genuinely interested in
other people is a most important quality for a sales-person to
possess - for any person, for that matter."
I have discovered from personal experience that one can win the
attention and time and cooperation of even the most sought-after
people by becoming genuinely interested in them. Let me illustrate.
Years ago I conducted a course in fiction writing at the Brooklyn
Institute of Arts and Sciences, and we wanted such distinguished and
busy authors as Kathleen Norris, Fannie Hurst, Ida Tarbell, Albert
Payson Terhune and Rupert Hughes to come to Brooklyn and give us
the benefit of their experiences. So we wrote them, saying we
admired their work and were deeply interested in getting their advice
and learning the secrets of their success.
Each of these letters was signed by about a hundred and fifty
students. We said we realized that these authors were busy - too
busy to prepare a lecture. So we enclosed a list of questions for
them to answer about themselves and their methods of work. They
liked that. Who wouldn't like it? So they left their homes and traveled
to Brooklyn to give us a helping hand.
By using the same method, I persuaded Leslie M. Shaw, secretary of
the treasury in Theodore Roosevelt's cabinet; George W.
Wickersham, attorney general in Taft's cabinet; William Jennings
Bryan; Franklin D. Roosevelt and many other prominent men to
come to talk to the students of my courses in public speaking.
All of us, be we workers in a factory, clerks in an office or even a
king upon his throne - all of us like people who admire us. Take the
German Kaiser, for example. At the close of World War I he was
probably the most savagely and universally despised man on this
earth. Even his own nation turned against him when he fled over into
Holland to save his neck. The hatred against him was so intense that
millions of people would have loved to tear him limb from limb or
burn him at the stake. In the midst of all this forest fire of fury, one
little boy wrote the Kaiser a simple, sincere letter glowing with
kindliness and admiration. This little boy said that no matter what
the others thought, he would always love Wilhelm as his Emperor.
The Kaiser was deeply touched by his letter and invited the little boy
to come to see him. The boy came, so did his mother - and the
Kaiser married her. That little boy didn't need to read a book on how
to win friends and influence people. He knew how instinctively.
If we want to make friends, let's put ourselves out to do things for
other people - things that require time, energy, unselfishness and
thoughtfulness. When the Duke of Windsor was Prince of Wales, he
was scheduled to tour South America, and before he started out on
that tour he spent months studying Spanish so that he could make
public talks in the language of the country; and the South Americans
loved him for it.
For years I made it a point to find out the birthdays of my friends.
How? Although I haven't the foggiest bit of faith in astrology, I
began by asking the other party whether he believed the date of
one's birth has anything to do with character and disposition. I then
asked him or her to tell me the month and day of birth. If he or she
said November 24, for example, I kept repeating to myself,
"November 24, November 24." The minute my friend's back was
turned, I wrote down the name and birthday and later would transfer
it to a birthday book. At the beginning of each year, I had these
birthday dates scheduled in my calendar pad so that they came to
my attention automatically. When the natal day arrived, there was
my letter or telegram. What a hit it made! I was frequently the only
person on earth who remembered.
If we want to make friends, let's greet people with animation and
enthusiasm. When somebody calls you on the telephone use the
same psychology. Say "Hello" in tones that bespeak how pleased
YOU are to have the person call. Many companies train their
telephone operatars to greet all callers in a tone of voice that
radiates interest and enthusiasm. The caller feels the company is
concerned about them. Let's remember that when we answer the
telephone tomorrow.
Showing a genuine interest in others not only wins friends for you,
but may develop in its customers a loyalty to your company. In an
issue of the publication of the National Bank of North America of
New York, the following letter from Madeline Rosedale, a depositor,
was published: *
* Eagle, publication of the Natirmal Bank of North America, h-ew
York, March 31, 1978.
"I would like you to know how much I appreciate your staff.
Everyone is so courteous, polite and helpful. What a pleasure it is,
after waiting on a long line, to have the teller greet you pleasantly.
"Last year my mother was hospitalized for five months. Frequently I
went to Marie Petrucello, a teller. She was concerned about my
mother and inquired about her progress."
Is there any doubt that Mrs. Rosedale will continue to use this bank?
Charles R. Walters, of one of the large banks in New York City, was
assigned to prepare a confidential report on a certain corporation. He
knew of only one person who possessed the facts he needed so
urgently. As Mr. Walters was ushered into the president's office, a
young woman stuck her head through a door and told the president
that she didn't have any stamps for him that day.
"I am collecting stamps for my twelve-year-old son," the president
explained to Mr. Walters.
Mr. Walters stated his mission and began asking questions. The
president was vague, general, nebulous. He didn't want to talk, and
apparently nothing could persuade him to talk. The interview was
brief and barren.
"Frankly, I didn't know what to do," Mr. Walters said as he related
the story to the class. "Then I remembered what his secretary had
said to him - stamps, twelve-year-old son. . . And I also recalled that
the foreign department of our bank collected stamps - stamps taken
from letters pouring in from every continent washed by the seven
seas.
"The next afternoon I called on this man and sent in word that I had
some stamps for his boy. Was I ushered in with enthusiasm? Yes sir,
He couldn't have shaken my hand with more enthusiasm if he had
been running for Congress. He radiated smiles and good will. 'My
George will love this one,' he kept saying as he fondled the stamps.
'And look at this! This is a treasure.'
"We spent half an hour talking stamps and looking at a picture of his
boy, and he then devoted more than an hour of his time to giving
me every bit of information I wanted - without my even suggesting
that he do it. He told me all he knew, and then called in his
subordinates and questioned them. He telephoned some of his
associates. He loaded me down with facts, figures, reports and
correspondence. In the parlance of newspaper reporters, I had a
scoop."
Here is another illustration:
C. M. Knaphle, Jr., of Philadelphia had tried for years to sell fuel to a
large chain-store organization. But the chain-store company
continued to purchase its fuel from an out-of-town dealer and haul it
right past the door of Knaphle's office. Mr, Knaphle made a speech
one night before one of my classes, pouring out his hot wrath upon
chain stores, branding them as a curse to the nation.
And still he wondered why he couldn't sell them.
I suggested that he try different tactics. To put it briefly, this is what
happened. We staged a debate between members of the course on
whether the spread of the chain store is doing the country more
harm than good.
Knaphle, at my suggestion, took the negative side; he agreed to
defend the chain stores, and then went straight to an executive of
the chain-store organization that he despised and said: "I am not
here to try to sell fuel. I have come to ask you to do me a favor." He
then told about his debate and said, "I have come to you for help
because I can't think of anyone else who would be more capable of
giving me the facts I want. I'm anxious to win this debate, and I'll
deeply appreciate whatever help you can give me."
Here is the rest of the story in Mr. Knaphle's own words:
I had asked this man for precisely one minute of his time. It was
with that understanding that he consented to see me. After I had
stated my case, he motioned me to a chair and talked to me for
exactly one hour and forty-seven minutes. He called in another
executive who had written a book on chain stores. He wrote to the
National Chain Store Association and secured for me a copy of a
debate on the subject. He feels that the chain store is rendering a
real service to humanity. He is proud of what he is doing for
hundreds of communities. His eyes fairly glowed as he talked, and I
must confess that he opened my eyes to things I had never even
dreamed of. He changed my whole mental attitude. As I was leaving,
he walked with me to the door, put his arm around my shoulder,
wished me well in my debate, and asked me to stop in and see him
again and let him know how I made out. The last words he said to
me were: "Please see me again later in the spring. I should like to
place an order with you for fuel."
To me that was almost a miracle. Here he was offering to buy fuel
without my even suggesting it. I had made more headway in two
hours by becoming genuinely interested in him and his problems
than I could have made in ten years trying to get him interested in
me and my product.
You didn't discover a new truth, Mr. Knaphle, for a long time ago, a
hundred years before Christ was born a famous old Roman poet,
Publilius Syrus, remarked; "We are interested in others when they
are interested in us."
A show of interest, as with every other principle of human relations,
must be sincere. It must pay off not only for the person showing the
interest, but for the person receiving the attention. It is a two-way
street-both parties benefit.
Martin Ginsberg, who took our Course in Long Island New York,
reported how the special interest a nurse took in him profoundly
affected his life:
"It was Thanksgiving Day and I was ten years old. I was in a welfare
ward of a city hospital and was scheduled to undergo major
orthopedic surgery the next day. I knew that I could only look
forward to months of confinement, convalescence and pain. My
father was dead; my mother and I lived alone in a small apartment
and we were on welfare. My mother was unable to visit me that day.
"As the day went on, I became overwhelmed with the feeling of
loneliness, despair and fear. I knew my mother was home alone
worrying about me, not having anyone to be with, not having anyone
to eat with and not even having enough money to afford a
Thanksgiving Day dinner.
"The tears welled up in my eyes, and I stuck my head under the
pillow and pulled the covers over it, I cried silently, but oh so bitterly,
so much that my body racked with pain.
"A young student nurse heard my sobbing and came over to me. She
took the covers off my face and started wiping my tears. She told me
how lonely she was, having to work that day and not being able to
be with her family. She asked me whether I would have dinner with
her. She brought two trays of food: sliced turkey, mashed a
potatoes, cranberry sauce and ice cream for dessert. She talked to
me and tried to calm my fears. Even though she was scheduled to go
off duty at 4 P.M., she stayed on her own time until almost 11 P.M.
She played games with me, talked to me and stayed with me until I
finally fell asleep.
"Many Thanksgivings have come and gone since I was ten, but one
never passes without me remembering that particular one and my
feelings of frustration, fear, loneliness and the warmth and
tenderness of the stranger that somehow made it all bearable."
If you want others to like you, if you want to develop real
friendships, if you want to help others at the same time as you help
yourself, keep this principle in mind:
? Principle 1 Become genuinely interested in other people.

2 - A Simple Way To Make A Good First Impression
At a dinner party in New York, one of the guests, a woman who had
inherited money, was eager to make a pleasing impression on
everyone. She had squandered a modest fortune on sables,
diamonds and pearls. But she hadn't done anything whatever about
her face. It radiated sourness and selfishness. She didn't realize what
everyone knows: namely, that the expression one wears on one's
face is far more important than the clothes one wears on one's back.
Charles Schwab told me his smile had been worth a million dollars.
And he was probably understating the truth. For Schwab's
personality, his charm, his ability to make people like him, were
almost wholly responsible for his extraordinary success; and one of
the most delightful factors in his personality was his captivating
smile.
Actions speak louder than words, and a smile says, "I like you, You
make me happy. I am glad to see you." That is why dogs make such
a hit. They are so glad to see us that they almost jump out of their
skins. So, naturally, we are glad to see them.
A baby's smile has the same effect.
Have you ever been in a doctor's waiting room and looked around at
all the glum faces waiting impatiently to be seen? Dr, Stephen K.
Sproul, a veterinarian in Raytown, Missouri, told of a typical spring
day when his waiting room was full of clients waiting to have their
pets inoculated. No one was talking to anyone else, and all were
probably thinking of a dozen other things they would rather be doing
than "wasting time" sitting in that office. He told one of our classes:
"There were six or seven clients waiting when a young woman came
in with a nine-month-old baby and a kitten. As luck would have it,
she sat down next to a gentleman who was more than a little
distraught about the long wait for service. The next thing he knew,
the baby just looked up at him with that great big smile that is so
characteristic of babies. What did that gentleman do? Just what you
and I would do, of course; he-smiled back at the baby. Soon he
struck up a conversation with the woman about her baby and his
grandchildren, and soon the entire reception room joined in, and the
boredom and tension were converted into a pleasant and enjoyable
experience."
An insincere grin? No. That doesn't fool anybody. We know it is
mechanical and we resent it. I am talking about a real smile, a
heartwarming smile, a smile that comes from within, the kind of
smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace.
Professor James V. McConnell, a psychologist at the University of
Michigan, expressed his feelings about a smile. "People who smile,"
he said, "tend to manage teach and sell more effectively, and to
raise happier children. There's far more information in a smile than a
frown. That's why encouragement is a much more effective teaching
device than punishment."
The employment manager of a large New York department store told
me she would rather hire a sales clerk who hadn't finished grade
school, if he or she has a pleasant smile, than to hire a doctor of
philosophy with a somber face.
The effect of a smile is powerful - even when it is unseen. Telephone
companies throughout the United States have a program called
"phone power" which is offered to employees who use the telephone
for selling their services or products. In this program they suggest
that you smile when talking on the phone. Your "smile" comes
through in your voice.
Robert Cryer, manager of a computer department for a Cincinnati,
Ohio, company, told how he had successfully found the right
applicant for a hard-to-fill position:
"I was desperately trying to recruit a Ph.D. in computer science for
my department. I finally located a young man with ideal
qualifications who was about to be graduated from Purdue
University. After several phone conversations I learned that he had
several offers from other companies, many of them larger and better
known than mine. I was delighted when he accepted my offer. After
he started on the job, I asked him why he had chosen us over the
others. He paused for a moment and then he said: 'I think it was
because managers in the other companies spoke on the phone in a
cold, business-like manner, which made me feel like just another
business transaction, Your voice sounded as if you were glad to hear
from me ... that you really wanted me to be part of your
organization. ' You can be assured, I am still answering my phone
with a smile."
The chairman of the board of directors of one of the largest rubber
companies 'in the United States told me that, according to his
observations, people rarely succeed at anything unless they have fun
doing it. This industrial leader doesn't put much faith in the old
adage that hard work alone is the magic key that will unlock the door
to our desires, "I have known people," he said, "who succeeded
because they had a rip-roaring good time conducting their business.
Later, I saw those people change as the fun became work. The
business had grown dull, They lost all joy in it, and they failed."
You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to
have a good time meeting you.
I have asked thousands of business people to smile at someone
every hour of the day for a week and then come to class and talk
about the results. How did it work? Let's see ... Here is a letter from
William B. Steinhardt, a New York stockbroker. His case isn't isolated.
In fact, it is typical of hundreds of cases.
"1 have been married for over eighteen years," wrote Mr. Steinhardt,
"and in all that time I seldom smiled at my wife or spoke two dozen
words to her from the time I got up until I was ready to leave for
business. I was one of the worst grouches who ever walked down
Broadway.
"When you asked me to make a talk about my experience with
smiles, I thought I would try it for a week. So the next morning,
while combing my hair, I looked at my glum mug in the mirror and
said to myself, 'Bill, you are going to wipe the scowl off that sour
puss of yours today. You are going to smile. And you are going to
begin right now.' As I sat down to breakfast, I greeted my wife with
a 'Good morning, my dear,' and smiled as I said it.
"You warned me that she might be surprised. Well, you
underestimated her reaction. She was bewildered. She was shocked.
I told her that in the future she could expect this as a regular
occurrence, and I kept it up every morning.
"This changed attitude of mine brought more happiness into our
home in the two months since I started than there was during the
last year.
"As I leave for my office, I greet the elevator operator in the
apartment house with a 'Good morning' and a smile, I greet the
doorman with a smile. I smile at the cashier in the subway booth
when I ask for change. As I stand on the floor of the Stock
Exchange, I smile at people who until recently never saw me smile.
"I soon found that everybody was smiling back at me, I treat those
who come to me with complaints or grievances in a cheerful manner,
I smile as I listen to them and I find that adjustments are
accomplished much easier. I find that smiles are bringing me dollars,
many dollars every day.
"I share my office with another broker. One of his clerks is a likable
young chap, and I was so elated about the results I was getting that
I told him recently about my new philosophy of human relations. He
then confessed that when I first came to share my office with his
firm he thought me a terrible grouch - and only recently changed his
mind. He said I was really human when I smiled.
"I have also eliminated criticism from my system. I give appreciation
and praise now instead of condemnation. I have stopped talking
about what I want. I am now trying to see the other person's
viewpoint. And these things have literally revolutionized my life. I am
a totally different man, a happier man, a richer man, richer in
friendships and happiness - the only things that matter much after
all."
You don't feel like smiling? Then what? Two things. First, force
yourself to smile. If you are alone, force yourself to whistle or hum a
tune or sing. Act as if you were already happy, and that will tend to
make you happy. Here is the way the psychologist and philosopher
William James put it:
"Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go
together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more
direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which
is not.
"Thus the sovereign voluntary path to cheerfulness, if our
cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully and to act and speak as if
cheerfulness were already there. ..."
Every body in the world is seeking happiness - and there is one sure
way to find it. That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness
doesn't depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner
conditions.
It isn't what you have or who you are or where you are or what you
are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think
about it. For example, two people may be in the same place, doing
the same thing; both may have about an equal amount of money
and prestige - and yet one may be miserable and the other happy.
Why? Because of a different mental attitude. I have seen just as
many happy faces among the poor peasants toiling with their
primitive tools in the devastating heat of the tropics as I have seen in
air-conditioned offices in New York, Chicago or Los Angeles.
"There is nothing either good or bad," said Shakespeare, "but
thinking makes it so."
Abe Lincoln once remarked that "most folks are about as happy as
they make up their minds to be." He was right. I saw a vivid
illustration of that truth as I was walking up the stairs of the Long
Island Railroad station in New York. Directly in front of me thirty or
forty crippled boys on canes and crutches were struggling up the
stairs. One boy had to be carried up. I was astonished at their
laughter and gaiety. I spoke about it to one of.the men in charge of
the boys. "Oh, yes," he said, "when a boy realizes that he is going to
be a cripple for life, he is shocked at first; but after he gets over the
shock, he usually resigns himself to his fate and then becomes as
happy as normal boys."
I felt like taking my hat off to those boys. They taught me a lesson I
hope I shall never forget.
Working all by oneself in a closed-off room in an office not only is
lonely, but it denies one the opportunity of making friends with other
employees in the company. Se§ãora Maria Gonzalez of Guadalajara,
Mexico, had such a job. She envied the shared comradeship of other
people in the company as she heard their chatter and laughter. As
she passed them in the hall during the first weeks of her
employment, she shyly looked the other way.
After a few weeks, she said to herself, "Maria, you can't expect those
women to come to you. You have to go out and meet them. " The
next time she walked to the water cooler, she put on her brightest
smile and said, "Hi, how are you today" to each of the people she
met. The effect was immediate. Smiles and hellos were returned, the
hallway seemed brighter, the job friendlier.
Acquaintanceships developed and some ripened into friendships. Her
job and her life became more pleasant and interesting.
Peruse this bit of sage advice from the essayist and publisher Elbert
Hubbard - but remember, perusing it won't do you any good unless
you apply it:
Whenever you go out-of-doors, draw the chin in, carry the crown of
the head high, and fill the lungs to the utmost; drink in the sunshine;
greet your friends with a smile, and put soul into every handclasp.
Do not fear being misunderstood and do not waste a minute thinking
about your enemies. Try to fix firmly in your mind what you would
like to do; and then, without veering off direction, you will move
straight to the goal. Keep your mind on the great and splendid things
you would like to do, and then, as the days go gliding away, you will
find yourself unconsciously seizing upon the opportunities that are
required for the fulfillment of your desire, just as the coral insect
takes from the running tide the element it needs. Picture in your
mind the able, earnest, useful person you desire to be, and the
thought you hold is hourly transforming you into that particular
individual.. . . Thought is supreme. Preserve a right mental attitude -
the attitude of courage, frankness, and good cheer. To think rightly
is to create. All things come through desire and every sincere prayer
is answered. We become like that on which our hearts are fixed.
Carry your chin in and the crown of your head high. We are gods in
the chrysalis.
The ancient Chinese were a wise lot - wise in the ways of the world;
and they had a proverb that you and I ought to cut out and paste
inside our hats. It goes like this: "A man without a smiling face must
not open a shop."
Your smile is a messenger of your good will. Your smile brightens the
lives of all who see it. To someone who has seen a dozen people
frown, scowl or turn their faces away, your smile is like the sun
breaking through the clouds. Especially when that someone is under
pressure from his bosses, his customers, his teachers or parents or
children, a smile can help him realize that all is not hopeless - that
there is joy in the world.
Some years ago, a department store in New York City, in recognition
of the pressures its sales clerks were under during the Christmas
rush, presented the readers of its advertisements with the following
homely philosophy:
The Value Of A Smile At Christmas
It costs nothing, but creates much. It enriches those who receive,
without impoverishing those who give. It happens in a flash and the
memory of it sometimes lasts forever, None are so rich they can get
along without it, and none so poor but are richer for its benefits. It
creates happiness in the home, fosters good will in a business, and is
the countersign of friends. It is rest to the weary, daylight to the
discouraged, sunshine to the sad, and Nature's best antidote fee
trouble. Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed, or stolen, for it
is something that is no earthly good to anybody till it is given away.
And if in the last-minute rush of Christmas buying some of our
salespeople should be too tired to give you a smile, may we ask you
to leave one of yours? For nobody needs a smile so much as those
who have none left to give!
? Principle 2 - Smile.

3 - If You Don't Do This, You Are Headed For Trouble
Back in 1898, a tragic thing happened in Rockland County, New
York. A child had died, and on this particular day the neighbors were
preparing to go to the funeral.
Jim Farley went out to the barn to hitch up his horse. The ground
was covered with snow, the air was cold and snappy; the horse
hadn't been exercised for days; and as he was led out to the
watering trough, he wheeled playfully, kicked both his heels high in
the air, and killed Jim Farley. So the little village of Stony Point had
two funerals that week instead of one.
Jim Farley left behind him a widow and three boys, and a few
hundred dollars in insurance.
His oldest boy, Jim, was ten, and he went to work in a brickyard,
wheeling sand and pouring it into the molds and turning the brick on
edge to be dried by the sun. This boy Jim never had a chance to get
much education. But with his natural geniality, he had a flair for
making people like him, so he went into politics, and as the years
went by, he developed an uncanny ability for remembering people's
names.
He never saw the inside of a high school; but before he was forty-six
years of age, four colleges had honored him with degrees and he
had become chairman of the Democratic National Committee and
Postmaster General of the United States.
I once interviewed Jim Farley and asked him the secret of his
success. He said, "Hard work," and I said, "Don't be funny."
He then asked me what I thought was the reason for his success. I
replied: "I understand you can call ten thousand people by their first
names."
"No. You are wrong, " he said. "I can call fifty thousand people by
their first names."
Make no mistake about it. That ability helped Mr. Farley put Franklin
D. Roosevelt in the White House when he managed Roosevelt's
campaign in 1932.
During the years that Jim Farley traveled as a salesman for a gypsum
concern, and during the years that he held office as town clerk in
Stony Point, he built up a system for remembering names.
In the beginning, it was a very simple one. Whenever he met a new
acquaintance, he found out his or her complete name and some
facts about his or her family, business and political opinions. He fixed
all these facts well in mind as part of the picture, and the next time
he met that person, even if it was a year later, he was able to shake
hands, inquire after the family, and ask about the hollyhocks in the
backyard. No wonder he developed a following!
For months before Roosevelt's campaign for President began, Jim
Farley wrote hundreds of letters a day to people all over the western
and northwestern states. Then he hopped onto a train and in
nineteen days covered twenty states and twelve thousand miles,
traveling by buggy, train, automobile and boat. He would drop into
town, meet his people at lunch or breakfast, tea or dinner, and give
them a "heart-to-heart talk." Then he'd dash off again on another leg
of his journey.
As soon as he arrived back East, he wrote to one person in each
town he had visited, asking for a list of all the guests to whom he
had talked. The final list contained thousands and thousands of
names; yet each person on that list was paid the subtle flattery of
getting a personal letter from James Farley. These letters began
"Dear Bill" or "Dear Jane," and they were always signed "Jim."
Jim Farley discovered early in life that the average person is more
interested in his or her own name than in all the other names on
earth put together. Remember that name and call it easily, and you
have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or
misspell it - and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage.
For example, I once organized a public-speaking course in Paris and
sent form letters to all the American residents in the city. French
typists with apparently little knowledge of English filled in the names
and naturally they made blunders. One man, the manager of a large
American bank in Paris, wrote me a scathing rebuke because his
name had been misspelled.
Sometimes it is difficult to remember a name, particularly if it is hard
to pronounce. Rather than even try to learn it, many people ignore it
or call the person by an easy nickname. Sid Levy called on a
customer for some time whose name was Nicodemus Papadoulos.
Most people just called him "Nick." Levy told us: "I made a special
effort to say his name over several times to myself before I made my
call. When I greeted him by his full name: 'Good afternoon, Mr.
Nicodemus Papadoulos,' he was shocked. For what seemed like
several minutes there was no reply from him at all. Finally, he said
with tears rolling down his cheeks, 'Mr. Levy, in all the fifteen years I
have been in this country, nobody has ever made the effort to call
me by my right name.' "
What was the reason for Andrew Carnegie's success?
He was called the Steel King; yet he himself knew little about the
manufacture of steel. He had hundreds of people working for him
who knew far more about steel than he did.
But he knew how to handle people, and that is what made him rich.
Early in life, he showed a flair for organization, a genius for
leadership. By the time he was ten, he too had discovered the
astounding importance people place on their own name. And he
used that discovery to win cooperation. To illustrate: When he was a
boy back in Scotland, he got hold of a rabbit, a mother rabbit.
Presto! He soon had a whole nest of little rabbits - and nothing to
feed them. But he had a brilliant idea. He told the boys and girls in
the neighborhood that if they would go out and pull enough clover
and dandelions to feed the rabbits, he would name the bunnies in
their honor.
The plan worked like magic, and Carnegie never forgot it.
Years later, he made millions by using the same psychology in
business. For example, he wanted to sell steel rails to the
Pennsylvania Railroad. J. Edgar Thomson was the president of the
Pennsylvania Railroad then. So Andrew Carnegie built a huge steel
mill in Pittsburgh and called it the "Edgar Thomson Steel Works."
Here is a riddle. See if you can guess it. When the Pennsylvania
Railroad needed steel rails, where do you suppose J. Edgar Thomson
bought them?. . , From Sears, Roebuck? No. No. You're wrong.
Guess again. When Carnegie and George Pullman were battling each
other for supremacy in the railroad sleeping-car business, the Steel
King again remembered the lesson of the rabbits.
The Central Transportation Company, which Andrew Carnegie
controlled, was fighting with the company that Pullman owned. Both
were struggling to get the sleeping-car business of the Union Pacific
Railroad, bucking each other, slashing prices, and destroving all
chance of profit. Both Carnegie and Pullman had gone to New York
to see the board of directors of the Union Pacific. Meeting one
evening in the St. Nicholas Hotel, Carnegie said: "Good evening, Mr.
Pullman, aren't we making a couple of fools of ourselves?"
"What do you mean.?" Pullman demanded.
Then Carnegie expressed what he had on his mind - a merger of
their two interests. He pictured in glowing terms the mutual
advantages of working with, instead of against, each other. Pullman
listened attentively, but he was not wholly convinced. Finally he
asked, "What would you call the new company?" and Carnegie
replied promptly: "Why, the Pullman Palace Car Company, of
course."
Pullman's face brightened. "Come into my room," he said. "Let's talk
it over." That talk made industrial history.
This policy of remembering and honoring the names of his friends
and business associates was one of the secrets of Andrew Carnegie's
leadership. He was proud of the fact that he could call many of his
factory workers by their first names, and he boasted that while he
was personally in charge, no strike ever disturbed his flaming steel
mills.
Benton Love, chairman of Texas Commerce Banc-shares, believes
that the bigger a corporation gets, the colder it becomes. " One way
to warm it up," he said, "is to remember people's names. The
executive who tells me he can't remember names is at the same time
telling me he can't remember a significant part of his business and is
operating on quicksand."
Karen Kirsech of Rancho Palos Verdes, California, a flight attendant
for TWA, made it a practice to learn the names of as many
passengers in her cabin as possible and use the name when serving
them. This resulted in many compliments on her service expressed
both to her directly and to the airline. One passenger wrote: "I
haven't flown TWA for some time, but I'm going to start flying
nothing but TWA from now on. You make me feel that your airline
has become a very personalized airline and that is important to me."
People are so proud of their names that they strive to perpetuate
them at any cost. Even blustering, hard-boiled old P. T. Barnum, the
greatest showman of his time, disappointed because he had no sons
to carry on his name, offered his grandson, C. H. Seeley, $25,000
dollars if he would call himself "Barnum" Seeley.
For many centuries, nobles and magnates supported artists,
musicians and authors so that their creative works would be
dedicated to them.
Libraries and museums owe their richest collections to people who
cannot bear to think that their names might perish from the memory
of the race. The New York Public Library has its Astor and Lenox
collections. The Metropolitan Museum perpetuates the names of
Benjamin Altman and J. P. Morgan. And nearly every church is
beautified by stained-glass windows commemorating the names of
their donors. Many of the buildings on the campus of most
universities bear the names of donors who contributed large sums of
money for this honor.
Most people don't remember names, for the simple reason that they
don't take the time and energy necessary to concentrate and repeat
and fix names indelibly in their minds. They make excuses for
themselves; they are too busy.
But they were probably no busier than Franklin D. Roosevelt, and he
took time to remember and recall even the names of mechanics with
whom he came into contact.
To illustrate: The Chrysler organization built a special car for Mr.
Roosevelt, who could not use a standard car because his legs were
paralyzed. W. F. Chamberlain and a mechanic delivered it to the
White House. I have in front of me a letter from Mr. Chamberlain
relating his experiences. "I taught President Roosevelt how to handle
a car with a lot of unusual gadgets, but he taught me a lot about the
fine art of handling people.
"When I called at the White House," Mr. Chamberlain writes, "the
President was extremely pleasant and cheerful. He called me by
name, made me feel very comfortable, and particularly impressed
me with the fact that he was vitally interested in things I had to
show him and tell him. The car was so designed that it could be
operated entirely by hand. A crowd gathered around to look at the
car; and he remarked: 'I think it is marvelous. All you have to do is
to touch a button and it moves away and you can drive it without
effort. I think it is grand - I don't know what makes it go. I'd love to
have the time to tear it down and see how it works.'
"When Roosevelt's friends and associates admired the machine, he
said in their presence: 'Mr. Chamberlain, I certainly appreciate all the
time and effort you have spent in developing this car. It is a mighty
fine job.' He admired the radiator, the special rear-vision mirror and
clock, the special spotlight, the kind of upholstery, the sitting position
of the driver's seat, the special suitcases in the trunk with his
monogram on each suitcase. In other words, he took notice of every
detail to which he knew I had given considerable thought. He made
a point of bringing these various pieces of equipment to the attention
of Mrs. Roosevelt, Miss Perkins, the Secretary of Labor, and his
secretary. He even brought the old White House porter into the
picture by saying, 'George, you want to take particularly good care of
the suitcases.'
"When the driving lesson was finished, the President turned to me
and said: 'Well, Mr. Chamberlain, I have been keeping the Federal
Reserve Board waiting thirty minutes. I guess I had better get back
to work.'
"I took a mechanic with me to the White House. He was introduced
to Roosevelt when he arrived. He didn't talk to the President, and
Roosevelt heard his name only once. He was a shy chap, and he
kept in the background. But before leaving us, the President looked
for the mechanic, shook his hand, called him by name, and thanked
him for coming to Washington. And there was nothing perfunctory
about his thanks. He meant what he said. I could feel that.
"A few days after returning to New York, I got an autographed
photograph of President Roosevelt and a little note of thanks again
expressing his appreciation for my assistance. How he found time to
do it is a mystery to me ."
Franklin D. Roosevelt knew that one of the simplest, most obvious
and most important ways of gaining good will was by remembering
names and making people feel important - yet how many of us do it?
Half the time we are introduced to a stranger, we chat a few minutes
and can't even remember his or her name by the time we say
goodbye.
One of the first lessons a politician learns is this: "To recall a voter's
name is statesmanship. To forget it is oblivion."
And the ability to remember names is almost as important in
business and social contacts as it is in politics.
Napoleon the Third, Emperor of France and nephew of the great
Napoleon, boasted that in spite of all his royal duties he could
remember the name of every person he met.
His technique? Simple. If he didn't hear the name distinctly, he said,
"So sorry. I didn't get the name clearly." Then, if it was an unusual
name, he would say, "How is it spelled?"
During the conversation, he took the trouble to repeat the name
several times, and tried to associate it in his mind with the person's
features, expression and general appearance.
If the person was someone of importance, Napoleon went to even
further pains. As soon as His Royal Highness was alone, he wrote the
name down on a piece of paper, looked at it, concentrated on it,
fixed it securely in his mind, and then tore up the paper. In this way,
he gained an eye impression of the name as well as an ear
impression.
All this takes time, but "Good manners," said Emerson, "are made up
of petty sacrifices."
The importance of remembering and using names is not just the
prerogative of kings and corporate executives. It works for all of us.
Ken Nottingham, an employee of General Motors in Indiana, usually
had lunch at the company cafeteria. He noticed that the woman who
worked behind the counter always had a scowl on her face. "She had
been making sandwiches for about two hours and I was just another
sandwich to her. I told her what I wanted. She weighed out the ham
on a little scale, then she gave me one leaf of lettuce, a few potato
chips and handed them to me.
"The next day I went through the same line. Same woman, same
scowl. The only difference was I noticed her name tag. I smiled and
said, 'Hello, Eunice,' and then told her what I wanted. Well, she
forgot the scale, piled on the ham, gave me three leaves of lettuce
and heaped on the potato chips until they fell off the plate."
We should be aware of the magic contained in a name and realize
that this single item is wholly and completely owned by the person
with whom we are dealing and nobody else. The name sets the
individual apart; it makes him or her unique among all others. The
information we are imparting or the request we are making takes on
a special importance when we approach the situation with the name
of the individual. From the waitress to the senior executive, the
name will work magic as we deal with others.
? Principle 3 - Remember that a person's name is to that person the
sweetest and most important sound in any language.

4 - An Easy Way To Become A Good Conversationalist
Some time ago, I attended a bridge party. I don't play bridge - and
there was a woman there who didn't play bridge either. She had
discovered that I had once been Lowell Thomas' manager before he
went on the radio and that I had traveled in Europe a great deal
while helping him prepare the illustrated travel talks he was then
delivering. So she said: "Oh, Mr. Carnegie, I do want you to tell me
about all the wonderful places you have visited and the sights you
have seen."
As we sat down on the sofa, she remarked that she and her husband
had recently returned from a trip to Africa. "Africa!" I exclaimed.
"How interesting! I've always wanted to see Africa, but I never got
there except for a twenty-four-hour stay once in Algiers. Tell me, did
you visit the big-game country? Yes? How fortunate. I envy you. Do
tell me about Africa."
That kept her talking for forty-five minutes. She never again asked
me where I had been or what I had seen. She didn't want to hear
me talk about my travels. All she wanted was an interested listener,
so she could expand her ego and tell about where she had been.
Was she unusual? No. Many people are like that.
For example, I met a distinguished botanist at a dinner party given
by a New York book publisher. I had never talked with a botanist
before, and I found him fascinating. I literally sat on the edge of my
chair and listened while he spoke of exotic plants and experiments in
developing new forms of plant life and indoor gardens (and even told
me astonishing facts about the humble potato). I had a small indoor
garden of my own - and he was good enough to tell me how to solve
some of my problems.
As I said, we were at a dinner party. There must have been a dozen
other guests, but I violated all the canons of courtesy, ignored
everyone else, and talked for hours to the botanist.
Midnight came, I said good night to everyone and departed. The
botanist then turned to our host and paid me several flattering
compliments. I was "most stimulating." I was this and I was that,
and he ended by saying I was a "most interesting conversationalist."
An interesting conversationalist? Why, I had said hardly anything at
all. I couldn't have said anything if I had wanted to without changing
the subject, for I didn't know any more about botany than I knew
about the anatomy of a penguin. But I had done this: I had listened
intently. I had listened because I was genuinely interested. And he
felt it. Naturally that pleased him. That kind of listening is one of the
highest compliments we can pay anyone. "Few human beings,"
wrote Jack Woodford in Strangers in Love, "few human beings are
proof against the implied flattery of rapt attention." I went even
further than giving him rapt attention. I was "hearty in my
approbation and lavish in my praise."
I told him that I had been immensely entertained and instructed -
and I had. I told him I wished I had his knoledge - and I did. I told
him that I should love to wander the fields with him - and I have. I
told him I must see him again - and I did.
And so I had him thinking of me as a good conversationalist when, in
reality, I had been merely a good listener and had encouraged him
to talk.
What is the secret, the mystery, of a successful business interview?
Well, according to former Harvard president Charles W. Eliot, "There
is no mystery about successful business intercourse. ... Exclusive
attention to the person who is speaking to you is very important.
Nothing else is so flattering as that."
Eliot himself was a past master of the art of listening, Henry James,
one of America's first great novelists, recalled: "Dr. Eliot's listening
was not mere silence, but a form of activity. Sitting very erect on the
end of his spine with hands joined in his lap, making no movement
except that he revolved his thumbs around each other faster or
slower, he faced his interlocutor and seemed to be hearing with his
eyes as well as his ears. He listened with his mind and attentively
considered what you had to say while you said it. ... At the end of an
interview the person who had talked to him felt that he had had his
say."
Self-evident, isn't it? You don't have to study for four years in
Harvard to discover that. Yet I know and you know department store
owners who will rent expensive space, buy their goods economically,
dress their windows appealingly, spend thousands of dollars in
advertising and then hire clerks who haven't the sense to be good
listeners - clerks who interrupt customers, contradict them, irritate
them, and all but drive them from the store.
A department store in Chicago almost lost a regular customer who
spent several thousand dollars each year in that store because a
sales clerk wouldn't listen. Mrs. Henrietta Douglas, who took our
course in Chicago, had purchased a coat at a special sale. After she
had brought it home she noticed that there was a tear in the lining.
She came back the next day and asked the sales clerk to exchange
it. The clerk refused even to listen to her complaint. "You bought this
at a special sale," she said. She pointed to a sign on the wall. "Read
that," she exclaimed. " 'All sales are final.' Once you bought it, you
have to keep it. Sew up the lining yourself."
"But this was damaged merchandise," Mrs. Douglas complained.
"Makes no difference," the clerk interrupted. "Final's final "
Mrs. Douglas was about to walk out indignantly, swearing never to
return to that store ever, when she was greeted by the department
manager, who knew her from her many years of patronage. Mrs.
Douglas told her what had happened.
The manager listened attentively to the whole story, examined the
coat and then said: "Special sales are 'final' so we can dispose of
merchandise at the end of the season. But this 'no return' policy
does not apply to damaged goods. We will certainly repair or replace
the lining, or if you prefer, give you your money back."
What a difference in treatment! If that manager had not come along
and listened to the Customer, a long-term patron of that store could
have been lost forever.
Listening is just as important in one's home life as in the world of
business. Millie Esposito of Croton-on-Hudson, New York, made it her
business to listen carefully when one of her children wanted to speak
with her. One evening she was sitting in the kitchen with her son,
Robert, and after a brief discussion of something that was on his
mind, Robert said: "Mom, I know that you love me very much."
Mrs. Esposito was touched and said: "Of course I love you very
much. Did you doubt it?"
Robert responded: "No, but I really know you love me because
whenever I want to talk to you about something you stop whatever
you are doing and listen to me."
The chronic kicker, even the most violent critic, will frequently soften
and be subdued in the presence of a patient, sympathetic listener - a
listener who will he silent while the irate fault-finder dilates like a
king cobra and spews the poison out of his system. To illustrate: The
New York Telephone Company discovered a few years ago that it
had to deal with one of the most vicious customers who ever cursed
a customer service representative. And he did curse. He raved. He
threatened to tear the phone out by its roots. He refused to pay
certain charges that he declared were false. He wrote letters to the
newspapers. He filed innumerable complaints with the Public Service
Commission, and he started several suits against the telephone
company.
At last, one of the company's most skillful "trouble-shooters" was
sent to interview this stormy petrel. This "troubleshooter" listened
and let the cantankerous customer enjoy himself pouring out his
tirade. The telephone representative listened and said "yes" and
sympathized with his grievance.
"He raved on and I listened for nearlv three hours," the
"troubleshooter" said as he related his experiences before one of the
author's classes. "Then I went back and listened some more. I
interviewed him four times, and before the fourth visit was over I
had become a charter member of an organization he was starting.
He called it the 'Telephone Subscribers' Protective Association.' I am
still a member of this organization, and, so far as I know, I'm the
only member in the world today besides Mr. ----.
"I listened and sympathized with him on every point that he made
during these interviews. He had never had a telephone
representative talk with him that way before, and he became almost
friendly. The point on which I went to see him was not even
mentioned on the first visit, nor was it mentioned on the second or
third, but upon the fourth interview, I closed the case completely, he
paid all his bills in full, and for the first time in the history of his
difficulties with the telephone company he voluntarily withdrew his
complaints from the Public Service Commission."
Doubtless Mr. ----- had considered himself a holy crusader,
defending the public rights against callous exploitation. But in reality,
what he had really wanted was a feeling of importance. He got this
feeling of importance at first by kicking and complaining. But as soon
as he got his feeling of importance from a representative of the
company, his imagined grievances vanished into thin air.
One morning years ago, an angry customer stormed into the office
of Julian F. Detmer, founder of the Detmer Woolen Company, which
later became the world's largest distributor of woolens to the
tailoring trade.
"This man owed us a small sum of money," Mr. Detmer explained to
me. "The customer denied it, but we knew he was wrong. So our
credit department had insisted that he pay. After getting a number of
letters from our credit department, he packed his grip, made a trip to
Chicago, and hurried into my office to inform me not only that he
was not going to pay that bill, but that he was never going to buy
another dollar's worth of goods from the Detmer Woolen Company.
"I listened patiently to all he had to say. I was tempted to interrupt,
but I realized that would be bad policy, So I let him talk himself out.
When he finally simmered down and got in a receptive mood, I said
quietly: 'I want to thank vou for coming to Chicago to tell me about
this. You have done me a great favor, for if our credit department
has annoyed you, it may annoy other good customers, and that
would be just too bad. Believe me, I am far more eager to hear this
than you are to tell it.'
"That was the last thing in the world he expected me to say. I think
he was a trifle disappointed, because he had come to Chicago to tell
me a thing or two, but here I was thanking him instead of scrapping
with him. I assured him we would wipe the charge off the books and
forget it, because he was a very careful man with only one account
to look after, while our clerks had to look after thousands. Therefore,
he was less likely to be wrong than we were.
"I told him that I understood exactly how he felt and that, if I were
in his shoes, I should undoubtedly feel precisely as he did. Since he
wasn't going to buy from us anymore, I recommended some other
woolen houses.
"In the past, we had usually lunched together when he came to
Chicago, so I invited him to have lunch with me this day. He
accepted reluctantly, but when we came back to the office he placed
a larger order than ever before. He returned home in a softened
mood and, wanting to be just as fair with us as we had been with
him, looked over his bills, found one that had been mislaid, and sent
us a check with his apologies.
"Later, when his wife presented him with a baby boy, he gave his
son the middle name of Detmer, and he remained a friend and
customer of the house until his death twenty-two years afterwards."
Years ago, a poor Dutch immigrant boy washed the windows of a
bakery shop after school to help support his family. His people were
so poor that in addition he used to go out in the street with a basket
every day and collect stray bits of coal that had fallen in the gutter
where the coal wagons had delivered fuel. That boy, Edward Bok,
never got more than six years of schooling in his life; yet eventually
he made himself one of the most successful magazine editors in the
history of American journalism. How did he do it? That is a long
story, but how he got his start can be told briefly. He got his start by
using the principles advocated in this chapter.
He left school when he was thirteen and became an office boy for
Western Union, but he didn't for one moment give up the idea of an
education. Instead, he started to educate himself, He saved his
carfares and went without lunch until he had enough money to buy
an encyclopedia of American biography - and then he did an
unheard-of thing. He read the lives of famous people and wrote
them asking for additional information about their childhoods. He
was a good listener. He asked famous people to tell him more about
themselves. He wrote General James A. Garfield, who was then
running for President, and asked if it was true that he was once a
tow boy on a canal; and Garfield replied. He wrote General Grant
asking about a certain battle, and Grant drew a map for him and
invited this fourteen-year old boy to dinner and spent the evening
talking to him.
Soon our Western Union messenger boy was corresponding with
many of the most famous people in the nation: Ralph Waldo
Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Longfellow, Mrs. Abraham Lincoln,
Louisa May Alcott, General Sherman and Jefferson Davis. Not only
did he correspond with these distinguished people, but as soon as he
got a vacation, he visited many of them as a welcome guest in their
homes. This experience imbued him with a confidence that was
invaluable. These men and women fired him with a vision and
ambition that shaped his life. And all this, let me repeat, was made
possible solely by the application of the principles we are discussing
here.
Isaac F. Marcosson, a journalist who interviewed hundreds of
celebrities, declared that many people fail to make a favorable
impression because they don't listen attentively. "They have been so
much concerned with what they are going to say next that they do
not keep their ears open. ... Very important people have told me that
they prefer good listeners to good talkers, but the ability to listen
seems rarer than almost any other good trait ."
And not only important personages crave a good listener, but
ordinary folk do too. As the Reader's Digest once said: "Many
persons call a doctor when all they want is an audience,"
During the darkest hours of the Civil War, Lincoln wrote to an old
friend in Springfield, Illinois, asking him to come to Washington.
Lincoln said he had some problems he wanted to discuss with him.
The old neighbor called at the White House, and Lincoln talked to
him for hours about the advisability of issuing a proclamation freeing
the slaves. Lincoln went over all the arguments for and against such
a move, and then read letters and newspaper articles, some
denouncing him for not freeing the slaves and others denouncing
him for fear he was going to free them. After talking for hours,
Lincoln shook hands with his old neighbor, said good night, and sent
him back to Illinois without even asking for his opinion. Lincoln had
done all the talking himself. That seemed to clarify his mind. "He
seemed to feel easier after that talk," the old friend said. Lincoln
hadn't wanted advice, He had wanted merely a friendly, sympathetic
listener to whom he could unburden himself. That's what we all want
when we are in trouble. That is frequently all the irritated customer
wants, and the dissatisfied employee or the hurt friend.
One of the great listeners of modern times was Sigmund Freud. A
man who met Freud described his manner of listening: "It struck me
so forcibly that I shall never forget him. He had qualities which I had
never seen in any other man. Never had I seen such concentrated
attention. There was none of that piercing 'soul penetrating gaze'
business. His eyes were mild and genial. His voice was low and kind.
His gestures were few. But the attention he gave me, his
appreciation of what I said, even when I said it badly, was
extraordinary, You've no idea what it meant to be listened to like
that."
If you want to know how to make people shun you and laugh at you
behind your back and even despise you, here is the recipe: Never
listen to anyone for long. Talk incessantly about yourself. If you have
an idea while the other person is talking, don't wait for him or her to
finish: bust right in and interrupt in the middle of a sentence.
Do you know people like that? I do, unfortunately; and the
astonishing part of it is that some of them are prominent.
Bores, that is all they are - bores intoxicated with their own egos,
drunk with a sense of their own importance.
People who talk only of themselves think only of themselves. And
"those people who think only of themselves," Dr. Nicholas Murray
Butler, longtime president of Columbia University, said, "are
hopelessly uneducated. They are not educated," said Dr. Butler, "no
matter how instructed they may be."
So if you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive
listener. To be interesting, be interested. Ask questions that other
persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about
themselves and their accomplishments.
Remember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times
more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than
they are in you and your problems. A person's toothache means
more to that person than a famine in China which kills a million
people. A boil on one's neck interests one more than forty
earthquakes in Africa. Think of that the next time you start a
conversation.
? Principle 4 - Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about
themselves.

5 - How To Interest People
Everyone who was ever a guest of Theodore Roosevelt was
astonished at the range and diversity of his knowledge. Whether his
visitor was a cowboy or a Rough Rider, a New York politician or a
diplomat, Roosevelt knew what to say. And how was it done? The
answer was simple. Whenever Roosevelt expected a visitor, he sat
up late the night before, reading up on the subject in which he knew
his guest was particularly interested.
For Roosevelt knew, as all leaders know, that the royal road to a
person's heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.
The genial William Lyon Phelps, essayist and professor of literature
at Yale, learned this lesson early in life.
"When I was eight years old and was spending a weekend visiting
my Aunt Libby Linsley at her home in Stratford on the Housatonic,"
he wrote in his essay on Human Nature, "a middle-aged man called
one evening, and after a polite skirmish with my aunt, he devoted his
attention to me. At that time, I happened to be excited about boats,
and the visitor discussed the subject in a way that seemed to me
particularly interesting. After he left, I spoke of him with enthusiasm.
What a man! My aunt informed me he was a New York lawyer, that
he cared nothing whatever about boats - that he took not the
slightest interest in the subject. 'But why then did he talk all the time
about boats?'
" 'Because he is a gentleman. He saw you were interested in boats,
and he talked about the things he knew would interest and please
you. He made himself agreeable.' "
And William Lyon Phelps added: "I never forgot my aunt's remark."
As I write this chapter, I have before me a letter from Edward L.
Chalif, who was active in Boy Scout work.
"One day I found I needed a favor," wrote Mr. Chalif. "A big Scout
jamboree was coming off in Europe, and I wanted the president of
one of the largest corporations in America to pay the expenses of
one of my boys for the trip.
"Fortunately, just before I went to see this man, I heard that he had
drawn a check for a million dollars, and that after it was canceled, he
had had it framed.
"So the first thing I did when I entered his office was to ask to see
the check. A check for a million dollars! I told him I never knew that
anybody had ever written such a check, and that I wanted to tell my
boys that I had actually seen a check for a million dollars. He gladly
showed it to me; I admired it and asked him to tell me all about how
it happened to be drawn."
You notice, don't you, that Mr. Chalif didn't begin by talking about
the Boy Scouts, or the jamboree in Europe, or what it was he
wanted? He talked in terms of what interested the other man. Here's
the result:
"Presently, the man I was interviewing said: 'Oh, by the way, what
was it you wanted to see me about?' So I told him.
"To my vast surprise," Mr. Chalif continues, "he not only granted
immediately what I asked for, but much more. I had asked him to
send only one boy to Europe, but he sent five boys and myself, gave
me a letter of credit for a thousand dollars and told us to stay in
Europe for seven weeks. He also gave me letters of introduction to
his branch presidents, putting them at our service, and he himself
met us in Paris and showed us the town.
Since then, he has given jobs to some of the boys whose parents
were in want, and he is still active in our group.
"Yet I know if I hadn't found out what he was interested in, and got
him warmed up first, I wouldn't have found him one-tenth as easy to
approach."
Is this a valuable technique to use in business? Is it? Let's see, Take
Henry G. Duvernoy of Duvemoy and Sons, a wholesale baking firm in
New York.
Mr. Duvernoy had been trying to sell bread to a certain New York
hotel. He had called on the manager every week for four years. He
went to the same social affairs the manager attended. He even took
rooms in the hotel and lived there in order to get the business. But
he failed.
"Then," said Mr. Duvernoy, "after studying human relations, I
resolved to change my tactics. I decided to find out what interested
this man - what caught his enthusiasm.
"I discovered he belonged to a society of hotel executives called the
Hotel Greeters of America. He not only belonged, but his bubbling
enthusiasm had made him president of the organization, and
president of the International Greeters. No matter where its
conventions were held, he would be there.
"So when I saw him the next day, I began talking about the
Greeters. What a response I got. What a response! He talked to me
for half an hour about the Greeters, his tones vibrant with
enthusiasm. I could plainly see that this society was not only his
hobby, it was the passion of his life. Before I left his office, he had
'sold' me a membership in his organization.
"In the meantime, I had said nothing about bread. But a few days
later, the steward of his hotel phoned me to come over with samples
and prices.
" 'I don't know what you did to the old boy,' the steward greeted me,
'but he sure is sold on you!'
"Think of it! I had been drumming at that man for four years - trying
to get his business - and I'd still be drumming at him if I hadn't
finally taken the trouble to find out what he was interested in, and
what he enjoyed talking about."
Edward E. Harriman of Hagerstown, Maryland, chose to live in the
beautiful Cumberland Valley of Maryland after he completed his
military service. Unfortunately, at that time there were few jobs
available in the area. A little research uncovered the fact that a
number of companies in the area were either owned or controlled by
an unusual business maverick, R. J. Funkhouser, whose rise from
poverty to riches intrigued Mr. Harriman. However, he was known for
being inaccessible to job seekers. Mr. Harriman wrote:
"I interviewed a number of people and found that his major interest
was anchored in his drive for power and money. Since he protected
himself from people like me by use of a dedicated and stern
secretary, I studied her interests and goals and only then I paid an
unannounced visit at her office. She had been Mr. Funkhouser's
orbiting satellite for about fifteen years. When I told her I had a
proposition for him which might translate itself into financial and
political success for him, she became enthused. I also conversed
with her about her constructive participation in his success. After this
conversation she arranged for me to meet Mr. Funkhouser.
"I entered his huge and impressive office determined not to ask
directly for a job. He was seated behind a large carved desk and
thundered at me, 'How about it, young man?' I said, 'Mr.
Funkhouser, I believe I can make money for you.' He immediately
rose and invited me to sit in one of the large upholstered chairs. I
enumerated my ideas and the qualifications I had to realize these
ideas, as well as how they would contribute to his personal success
and that of his businesses.
" 'R. J.,' as he became known to me, hired me at once and for over
twenty years I have grown in his enterprises and we both have
prospered."
Talking in terms of the other person's interests pays off for both
parties. Howard Z. Herzig, a leader in the field of employee
communications, has always followed this principle. When asked
what reward he got from it, Mr. Herzig responded that he not only
received a different reward from each person but that in general the
reward had been an enlargement of his life each time he spoke to
someone.
? Principle 5 - Talk in terms of the other person's interests.

6 - How To Make People Like You Instantly
I was waiting in line to register a letter in the post office at Thirtythird
Street and Eighth Avenue in New York. I noticed that the clerk
appeared to be bored with the job -weighing envelopes, handing out
stamps, making change, issuing receipts - the same monotonous
grind year after year. So I said to myself: "I am going to try to make
that clerk like me. Obviously, to make him like me, I must say
something nice, not about myself, but about him. So I asked myself,
'What is there about him that I can honestly admire?' " That is
sometimes a hard question to answer, especially with strangers; but,
in this case, it happened to be easy. I instantly saw something I
admired no end.
So while he was weighing my envelope, I remarked with enthusiasm:
"I certainly wish I had your head of hair."
He looked up, half-startled, his face beaming with smiles. "Well, it
isn't as good as it used to be," he said modestly. I assured him that
although it might have lost some of its pristine glory, nevertheless it
was still magnificent. He was immensely pleased. We carried on a
pleasant little conversation and the last thing he said to me was:
"Many people have admired my hair."
I'll bet that person went out to lunch that day walking on air. I'll bet
he went home that night and told his wife about it. I'll bet he looked
in the mirror and said: "It is a beautiful head of hair."
I told this story once in public and a man asked me afterwards:
"'What did you want to get out of him?"
What was I trying to get out of him!!! What was I trying to get out of
him!!!
If we are so contemptibly selfish that we can't radiate a little
happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to
get something out of the other person in return - if our souls are no
bigger than sour crab apples, we shall meet with the failure we so
richly deserve. Oh yes, I did want something out of that chap. I
wanted something priceless. And I got it. I got the feeling that I had
done something for him without his being able to do anything
whatever in return for me. That is a feeling that flows and sings in
your memory lung after the incident is past.
There is one all-important law of human conduct. If we obey that
law, we shall almost never get into trouble. In fact, that law, if
obeyed, will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But
the very instant we break the law, we shall get into endless trouble.
The law is this: Always make the other person feel important. John
Dewey, as we have already noted, said that the desire to be
important is the deepest urge in human nature; and William James
said: "The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be
appreciated." As I have already pointed out, it is this urge that
differentiates us from the animals. It is this urge that has been
responsible for civilization itself.
Philosophers have been speculating on the rules of human
relationships for thousands of years, and out of all that speculation,
there has evolved only one important precept. It is not new. It is as
old as history. Zoroaster taught it to his followers in Persia twentyfive
hundred years ago. Confucius preached it in China twenty-four
centuries ago. Lao-tse, the founder of Taoism, taught it to his
disciples in the Valley of the Han. Buddha preached it on the bank of
the Holy Ganges five hundred years before Christ. The sacred books
of Hinduism taught it a thousand years before that. Jesus taught it
among the stony hills of Judea nineteen centuries ago. Jesus
summed it up in one thought -probably the most important rule in
the world: "Do unto others as you would have others do unto you."
You want the approval of those with whom you come in contact. You
want recognition of your true worth. You want a feeling that you are
important in your little world. You don't want to listen to cheap,
insincere flattery, but you do crave sincere appreciation. You want
your friends and associates to be, as Charles Schwab put it, "hearty
in their approbation and lavish in their praise." All of us want that.
So let's obey the Golden Rule, and give unto others what we would
have others give unto us, How? When? Where? The answer is: All
the time, everywhere.
David G. Smith of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, told one of our classes how
he handled a delicate situation when he was asked to take charge of
the refreshment booth at a charity concert,
"The night of the concert I arrived at the park and found two elderly
ladies in a very bad humor standing next to the refreshment stand.
Apparently each thought that she was in charge of this project. As I
stood there pondering what to do, me of the members of the
sponsoring committee appeared and handed me a cash box and
thanked me for taking over the project. She introduced Rose and
Jane as my helpers and then ran off.
"A great silence ensued. Realizing that the cash box was a symbol of
authority (of sorts), I gave the box to Rose and explained that I
might not be able to keep the money straight and that if she took
care of it I would feel better. I then suggested to Jane that she show
two teenagers who had been assigned to refreshments how to
operate the soda machine, and I asked her to be responsible for that
part of the project.
"The evening was very enjoyable with Rose happily counting the
money, Jane supervising the teenagers, and me enjoying the
concert."
You don't have to wait until you are ambassador to France or
chairman of the Clambake Committee of your lodge before you use
this philosophy of appreciation. You can work magic with it almost
every day.
If, for example, the waitress brings us mashed potatoes when we
have ordered French fried, let's say: "I'm sorry to trouble you, but I
prefer French fried." She'll probably reply, "No trouble at all" and will
be glad to change the potatoes, because we have shown respect for
her.
Little phrases such as "I'm sorry to trouble you," "Would you be so
kind as to ----? " "Won't you please?" " Would you mind?" "Thank
you" - little courtesies like these oil the cogs of the monotonous
grind of everyday life- and, incidentally, they are the hallmark of
good breeding.
Let's take another illustration. Hall Caine's novels-The Christian, The
Deemster, The Manxman, among them - were all best-sellers in the
early part of this century. Millions of people read his novels,
countless millions. He was the son of a blacksmith. He never had
more than eight years' schooling in his life; yet when he died he was
the richest literary man of his time.
The story goes like this: Hall Caine loved sonnets and ballads; so he
devoured all of Dante Gabriel Rossetti's poetry. He even wrote a
lecture chanting the praises of Rossetti's artistic achievement-and
sent a copy to Rossetti himself. Rossetti was delighted. "Any young
man who has such an exalted opinion of my ability," Rossetti
probably said to himself, "must be brilliant," So Rossetti invited this
blacksmith's son to come to London and act as his secretary. That
was the turning point in Hall Caine's life; for, in his new position, he
met the literary artists of the day. Profiting by their advice and
inspired by their encouragement, he launched upon a career that
emblazoned his name across the sky.
His home, Greeba Castle, on the Isle of Man, became a Mecca for
tourists from the far corners of the world, and he left a multimillion
dollar estate. Yet - who knows - he might have died poor and
unknown had he not written an essay expressing his admiration for a
famous man.
Such is the power, the stupendous power, of sincere, heartfelt
appreciation.
Rossetti considered himself important. That is not strange, Almost
everyone considers himself important, very important.
The life of many a person could probably be changed if only
someone would make him feel important. Ronald J. Rowland, who is
one of the instructors of our course in California, is also a teacher of
arts and crafts. He wrote to us about a student named Chris in his
beginning crafts class:
Chris was a very quiet, shy boy lacking in self-confidence, the kind of
student that often does not receive the attention he deserves. I also
teach an advanced class that had grown to be somewhat of a status
symbol and a privilege for a student to have earned the right to be in
it. On Wednesday, Chris was diligently working at his desk. I really
felt there was a hidden fire deep inside him. I asked Chris if he
would like to be in the advanced class. How I wish I could express
the look in Chris's face, the emotions in that shy fourteen-year-old
boy, trying to hold back his tears.
"Who me, Mr. Rowland? Am I good enough?"
"Yes, Chris, you are good enough."
I had to leave at that point because tears were coming to my eyes.
As Chris walked out of class that day, seemingly two inches taller, he
looked at me with bright blue eyes and said in a positive voice,
"Thank you, Mr. Rowland."
Chris taught me a lesson I will never forget-our deep desire to feel
important. To help me never forget this rule, I made a sign which
reads "YOU ARE IMPORTANT." This sign hangs in the front of the
classroom for all to see and to remind me that each student I face is
equally important.
The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel
themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their
hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize
their importance, and recognize it sincerely.
Remember what Emerson said: "Every man I meet is my superior in
some way. In that, I learn of him."
And the pathetic part of it is that frequently those who have the least
justification for a feeling of achievement bolster up their egos by a
show of tumult and conceit which is truly nauseating. As
Shakespeare put it: "... man, proud man,/Drest in a little brief
authority,/ ... Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven/As make
the angels weep."
I am going to tell you how business people in my own courses have
applied these principles with remarkable results. Let's take the case
of a Connecticut attorney (because of his relatives he prefers not to
have his name mentioned).
Shortly after joining the course, Mr. R----- drove to Long Island with
his wife to visit some of her relatives. She left him to chat with an old
aunt of hers and ther rushed off by herself to visit some of the
younger relatives. Since he soon had to give a speech professionally
on how he applied the principles of appreciation, he thought he
would gain some worthwhile experience talking with the-elderly lady.
So he looked around the house to see what he could honestly
admire.
"This house was built about 1890, wasn't it?" he inquired.
"Yes," she replied, "that is precisely the year it was built."
"It reminds me of the house I was born in," he said. "It's beautiful.
Well built. Roomy. You know, they don't build houses like this
anymore."
"You're right," the old lady agreed. "The young folks nowadays don't
care for beautiful homes. All they want is a small apartment, and
then they go off gadding about in their automobiles.
"This is a dream house," she said in a voice vibrating with tender
memories. "This house was built with love. My husband and I
dreamed about it for years before we built it. We didn't have an
architect. We planned it all ourselves."
She showed Mr. R----- about the house, and he expressed his hearty
admiration for the beautiful treasures she had picked up in her
travels and cherished over a lifetime - paisley shawls, an old English
tea set, Wedgwood china, French beds and chairs, Italian paintings,
and silk draperies that had once hung in a French chateau.
After showing Mr. R----- through the house, she took him out to the
garage. There, jacked up on blocks, was a Packard car - in mint
condition.
"My husband bought that car for me shortly before he passed on,"
she said softly. "I have never ridden in it since his death. ... You
appreciate nice things, and I'm going to give this car to you."
"Why, aunty," he said, "you overwhelm me. I appreciate your
generosity, of course; but I couldn't possibly accept it. I'm not even
a relative of yours. I have a new car, and you have many relatives
that would like to have that Packard."
"Relatives!" she exclaimed. "Yes, I have relatives who are just
waiting till I die so they can get that car. But they are not going to
get it."
"If you don't want to give it to them, you can very easily sell it to a
secondhand dealer," he told her.
"Sell it!" she cried. "Do you think I would sell this car? Do you think I
could stand to see strangers riding up and down the street in that
car - that car that my husband bought for me? I wouldn't dream of
selling it. I'm going to give it to you. You appreciate beautiful
things."
He tried to get out of accepting the car, but he couldn't without
hurting her feelings.
This lady, left all alone in a big house with her paisley shawls, her
French antiques, and her memories, was starving for a little
recognition, She had once been young and beautiful and sought
after She had once built a house warm with love and had collected
things from all over Europe to make it beautiful. Now, in the isolated
loneliness of old age, she craved a little human warmth, a little
genuine appreciation - and no one gave it to her. And when she
found it, like a spring in the desert, her gratitude couldn't adequately
express itself with anything less than the gift of her cherished
Packard.
Let's take another case: Donald M. McMahon, who was
superintendent of Lewis and Valentine, nurserymen and landscape
architects in Rye, New York, related this incident:
"Shortly after I attended the talk on 'How to Win Friends and
Influence People,' I was landscaping the estate of a famous attorney.
The owner came out to give me a few instructions about where he
wished to plant a mass of rhododendrons and azaleas.
"I said, 'Judge, you have a lovely hobby. I've been admiring your
beautiful dogs. I understand you win a lot of blue ribbons every year
at the show in Madison Square Garden.'
"The effect of this little expression of appreciation was striking.
" 'Yes,' the judge replied, 'I do have a lot of fun with my dogs. Would
you like to see my kennel?'
"He spent almost an hour showing me his dogs and the prizes they
had won. He even brought out their pedigrees and explained about
the bloodlines responsible for such beauty and intelligence.
"Finally, turning to me, he asked: 'Do you have any small children?'
" 'Yes, I do,' I replied, 'I have a son.'
" 'Well, wouldn't he like a puppy?' the judge inquired.
" 'Oh, yes, he'd be tickled pink.'
" 'All right, I'm going to give him one,' the . judge announced.
He started to tell me how to feed the puppy. Then he paused. 'You'll
forget it if I tell you. I'll write it out.' So the judge went in the house,
typed out the pedigree and feeding instructions, and gave me a
puppy worth several hundred dollars and one hour and fifteen
minutes of his valuable time largely because I had expressed my
honest admiration for his hobby and achievements."
George Eastman, of Kodak fame, invented the transparent film that
made motion pictures possible, amassed a fortune of a hundred
million dollars, and made himself one of the most famous
businessmen on earth. Yet in spite of all these tremendous
accomplishments, he craved little recognitions even as you and I.
To illustrate: When Eastman was building the Eastman School of
Music and also Kilbourn Hall in Rochester, James Adamson, then
president of the Superior Seating Company of New York, wanted to
get the order to supply the theater chairs for these buildings.
Phoning the architect, Mr. Adamson made an appointment to see Mr.
Eastman in Rochester.
When Adamson arrived, the architect said: "I know you want to get
this order, but I can tell you right now that you won't stand a ghost
of a show if you take more than five minutes of George Eastman's
time. He is a strict disciplinarian. He is very busy. So tell your story
quickly and get out."
Adamson was prepared to do just that.
When he was ushered into the room he saw Mr. Eastman bending
over a pile of papers at his desk. Presently, Mr. Eastman looked up,
removed his glasses, and walked toward the architect and Mr.
Adamson, saying: "Good morning, gentlemen, what can I do for
you?"
The architect introduced them, and then Mr. Adamson said: "While
we've been waiting for you, Mr. Eastman, I've been admiring your
office. I wouldn't mind working in a room like this myself. I'm in the
interior-woodworking business, and I never saw a more beautiful
office in all my life."
George Eastman replied: "You remind me of something I had almost
forgotten. It is beautiful, isn't it? I enjoyed it a great deal when it
was first built. But I come down here now with a lot of other things
on my mind and sometimes don't even see the room for weeks at a
time ."
Adamson walked over and rubbed his hand across a panel. "This is
English oak, isn't it? A little different texture from Italian oak."
"Yes," Eastman replied. "Imported English oak. It was selected for
me by a friend who specializes in fine woods ."
Then Eastman showed him about the room, commenting on the
proportions, the coloring, the hand carving and other effects he had
helped to plan and execute.
While drifting about the room, admiring the wood-work, they paused
before a window, and George Eastman, in his modest, soft-spoken
way, pointed out some of the institutions through which he was
trying to help humanity: the University of Rochester, the General
Hospital, the Homeopathic Hospital, the Friendly Home, the
Children's Hospital. Mr. Adamson congratulated him warmly on the
idealistic way he was using his wealth to alleviate the sufferings of
humanity. Presently, George Eastman unlocked a glass case and
pulled out the first camera he had ever owned - an invention he had
bought from an Englishman.
Adamson questioned him at length about his early struggles to get
started in business, and Mr. Eastman spoke with real feeling about
the poverty of his childhood, telling how his widowed mother had
kept a boardinghouse while he clerked in an insurance office. The
terror of poverty haunted him day and night, and he resolved to
make enough money so that his mother wouldn't have to work, Mr.
Adamson drew him out with further questions and listened,
absorbed, while he related the story of his experiments with dry
photographic plates. He told how he had worked in an office all day,
and sometimes experimented all night, taking only brief naps while
the chemicals were working, sometimes working and sleeping in his
clothes for seventy-two hours at a stretch.
James Adamson had been ushered into Eastman's office at tenfifteen
and had been warned that he must not take more than five
minutes; but an hour had passed, then two hours passed. And they
were still talking. Finally, George Eastman turned to Adamson and
said, "The last time I was in Japan I bought some chairs, brought
them home, and put them in my sun porch. But the sun peeled the
paint, so I went downtown the other day and bought some paint and
painted the chairs myself. Would you like to see what sort of a job I
can do painting chairs? All right. Come up to my home and have
lunch with me and I'll show you."
After lunch, Mr. Eastman showed Adamson the chairs he had
brought from Japan. They weren't worth more than a few dollars,
but George Eastman, now a multimillionaire, was proud of them
because he himself had painted them.
The order for the seats amounted to $90,000. Who do you suppose
got the order - James Adamson or one of his competitors?
From the time of this story until Mr. Eastman's death, he and James
Adamson were close friends.
Claude Marais, a restaurant owner in Rouen, France, used this
principle and saved his restaurant the loss of a key employee. This
woman had been in his employ for five years and was a vital link
between M. Marais and his staff of twenty-one people. He was
shocked to receive a registered letter from her advising him of her
resignation.
M. Marais reported: "I was very surprised and, even more,
disappointed, because I was under the impression that I had been
fair to her and receptive to her needs. Inasmuch as she was a friend
as well as an employee, I probably had taken her too much for
granted and maybe was even more demanding of her than of other
employees.
"I could not, of course, accept this resignation without some
explanation. I took her aside and said, 'Paulette, you must
understand that I cannot accept your resignation You mean a great
deal to me and to this company, and you are as important to the
success of this restaurant as I am.' I repeated this in front of the
entire staff, and I invited her to my home and reiterated my
confidence in her with my family present.
"Paulette withdrew her resignation, and today I can rely on her as
never before. I frequently reinforce this by expressing my
appreciation for what she does and showing her how important she
is to me and to the restaurant."

shrewdest men who ever ruled the British Empire. "Talk to people
about themselves and they will listen for hours ."

Part Three - How To Win People To Your Way Of Thinking
1 You Can't Win An Argument
Shortly after the close of World War I, I learned an invaluable lesson
one night in London. I was manager at the time for Sir Ross Smith.
During the war, Sir Ross had been the Australian ace out in
Palestine; and shortly after peace was declared, he astonished the
world by flying halfway around it in thirty days. No such feat had
ever been attempted before. It created a tremendous sensation. The
Australian government awarded him fifty thousand dollars; the King
of England knighted him; and, for a while, he was the most talkedabout
man under the Union Jack. I was attending a banquet one
night given in Sir Ross's honor; and during the dinner, the man
sitting next to me told a humorous story which hinged on the
quotation "There's a divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them
how we will."
The raconteur mentioned that the quotation was from the Bible. He
was wrong. I knew that, I knew it positively. There couldn't be the
slightest doubt about it. And so, to get a feeling of importance and
display my superiority, I appointed myself as an unsolicited and
unwelcome committee of one to correct him. He stuck to his guns.
What? From Shakespeare? Impossible! Absurd! That quotation was
from the Bible. And he knew it.
The storyteller was sitting on my right; and Frank Gammond, an old
friend of mine, was seated at my left. Mr. Gammond had devoted
years to the study of Shakespeare, So the storyteller and I agreed to
submit the question to Mr. Gammond. Mr. Gammond listened, kicked
me under the table, and then said: "Dale, you are wrong. The
gentleman is right. It is from the Bible."
On our way home that night, I said to Mr. Gammond: "Frank, you
knew that quotation was from Shakespeare,"
"Yes, of course," he replied, "Hamlet, Act Five, Scene Two. But we
were guests at a festive occasion, my dear Dale. Why prove to a
man he is wrong? Is that going to make him like you? Why not let
him save his face? He didn't ask for your opinion. He didn't want it.
Why argue with him? Always avoid the acute angle." The man who
said that taught me a lesson I'll never forget. I not only had made
the storyteller uncomfortable, but had put my friend in an
embarrassing situation. How much better it would have been had I
not become argumentative.
It was a sorely needed lesson because I had been an inveterate
arguer. During my youth, I had argued with my brother about
everything under the Milky Way. When I went to college, I studied
logic and argumentation and went in for debating contests. Talk
about being from Missouri, I was born there. I had to be shown.
Later, I taught debating and argumentation in New York; and once, I
am ashamed to admit, I planned to write a book on the subject.
Since then, I have listened to, engaged in, and watched the effect of
thousands of arguments. As a result of all this, I have come to the
conclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to get the
best of an argument - and that is to avoid it .
Avoid it as you would avoid rattlesnakes and earthquakes.
Nine times out of ten, an argument ends with each of the
contestants more firmly convinced than ever that he is absolutely
right.
You can't win an argument. You can't because if you lose it, you lose
it; and if you win it, you lose it. Why? Well, suppose you triumph
over the other man and shoot his argument full of holes and prove
that he is non compos mentis. Then what? You will feel fine. But
what about him? You have made him feel inferior. You have hurt his
pride. He will resent your triumph. And -
A man convinced against his will Is of the same opinion still.
Years ago Patrick J. O'Haire joined one of my classes. He had had
little education, and how he loved a scrap! He had once been a
chauffeur, and he came to me because he had been trying, without
much success, to sell trucks. A little questioning brought out the fact
that he was continually scrapping with and antagonizing the very
people he was trying to do business with, If a prospect said anything
derogatory about the trucks he was selling, Pat saw red and was
right at the customer's throat. Pat won a lot of arguments in those
days. As he said to me afterward, "I often walked out of an office
saving: 'I told that bird something.' Sure I had told him something,
but I hadn't sold him anything."
Mv first problem was not to teach Patrick J. O'Haire to talk. My
immediate task was to train him to refrain from talking and to avoid
verbal fights.
Mr. O'Haire became one of the star salesmen for the White Motor
Company in New York. How did he do it? Here is his story in his own
words: "If I walk into a buyer's office now and he says: 'What? A
White truck?
They're no good! I wouldn't take one if you gave it to me. I'm going
to buy the Whose-It truck,' I say, 'The Whose-It is a good truck. If
you buy the Whose-It, you'll never make a mistake. The Whose-Its
are made by a fine company and sold by good people.'
"He is speechless then. There is no room for an argument. If he says
the Whose-It is best and I say sure it is, he has to stop. He can't
keep on all afternoon saying, 'It's the best' when I'm agreeing with
him. We then get off the subject of Whose-It and I begin to talk
about the good points of the White truck.
"There was a time when a remark like his first one would have made
me see scarlet and red and orange. I would start arguing against the
Whose-It; and the more I argued against it, the more my prospect
argued in favor of it; and the more he argued, the more he sold
himself on my competitor's product.
"As I look back now I wonder how I was ever able to sell anything. I
lost years of my life in scrapping and arguing. I keep my mouth shut
now. It pays."
As wise old Ben Franklin used to say:
If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory
sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never get
your opponent's good will.
So figure it out for yourself. Which would you rather have, an
academic, theatrical victory or a person's good will? You can seldom
have both.
The Boston Transcript once printed this bit of significant doggerel:
Here lies the body of William Jay, . Who died maintaining his right of
way-He was right, dead right, as he sped along, But he's just as
dead as if he were wrong.
You may be right, dead right, as you speed along in your argument;
but as far as changing another's mind is concerned, you will probably
be just as futile as if you were wrong.
Frederick S. Parsons, an income tax consultant, had been disputing
and wrangling for an hour with a gover-ment tax inspector. An item
of nine thousand dollars was at stake. Mr. Parsons claimed that this
nine thousand dollars was in reality a bad debt, that it would never
be collected, that it ought not to be taxed. "Bad debt, my eye !"
retorted the inspector. "It must be taxed."
"This inspector was cold, arrogant and stubborn," Mr. Parsons said
as he told the story to the class. "Reason was wasted and so were
facts. . . The longer we argued, the more stubborn he became. So I
decided to avoid argument, change the subject, and give him
appreciation.
"I said, 'I suppose this is a very petty matter in comparison with the
really important and difficult decisions you're required to make. I've
made a study of taxation myself. But I've had to get my knowledge
from books. You are getting yours from the firing line of experience.
I sometime wish I had a job like yours. It would teach me a lot.' I
meant every word I said.
"Well." The inspector straightened up in his chair, leaned back, and
talked for a long time about his work, telling me of the clever frauds
he had uncovered. His tone gradually became friendly, and presently
he was telling me about his children. As he left, he advised me that
he would consider my problem further and give me his decision in a
few days.
"He called at my office three days later and informed me that he had
decided to leave the tax return exactly as it was filed."
This tax inspector was demonstrating one of the most common of
human frailties. He wanted a feeling of importance; and as long as
Mr. Parsons argued with him, he got his feeling of importance by
loudly asserting his authority. But as soon as his importance was
admitted and the argument stopped and he was permitted to expand
his ego, he became a sympathetic and kindly human being.
Buddha said: "Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love," and a
misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by tact,
diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other
person's viewpoint.
Lincoln once reprimanded a young army officer for indulging in a
violent controversy with an associate. "No man who is resolved to
make the most of himself," said Lincoln, "can spare time for personal
contention. Still less can he afford to take the consequences,
including the vitiation of his temper and the loss of self-control. Yield
larger things to which you show no more than equal rights; and yield
lesser ones though clearly your own. Better give your path to a dog
than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog
would not cure the bite."
In an article in Bits and Pieces,* some suggestions are made on how
to keep a disagreement from becoming an argument:
Welcome the disagreement. Remember the slogan, "When two
partners always agree, one of them is not necessary." If there is
some point you haven't thought about, be thankful if it is brought to
your attention. Perhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to be
corrected before you make a serious mistake.
Distrust your first instinctive impression. Our first natural reaction in
a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be careful. Keep calm and
watch out for your first reaction. It may be you at your worst, not
your best.
Control your temper. Remember, you can measure the size of a
person by what makes him or her angry.
Listen first. Give your opponents a chance to talk. Let them finish. Do
not resist, defend or debate. This only raises barriers. Try to build
bridges of understanding. Don't build higher barriers of
misunderstanding.
Look for areas of agreement. When you have heard your opponents
out, dwell first on the points and areas on which you agree.
Be honest, Look for areas where you can admit error and say so.
Apologize for your mistakes. It will help disarm your opponents and
reduce defensiveness.
Promise to think over your opponents' ideas and study them
carefully. And mean it. Your opponents may be right. It is a lot easier
at this stage to agree to think about their points than to move rapidly
ahead and find yourself in a position where your opponents can say:
"We tried to tell you, but you wouldn't listen."
Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Anyone who takes
the time to disagree with you is interested in the same things you
are. Think of them as people who really want to help you, and you
may turn your opponents into friends.
Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the
problem. Suggest that a new meeting be held later that day or the
next day, when all the facts may be brought to bear. In preparation
for this meeting, ask yourself some hard questions:
Could my opponents be right? Partly right? Is there truth or merit in
their position or argument? Is my reaction one that will relieve the
problem, or will it just relieve any frustration? Will my reaction drive
my opponents further away or draw them closer to me? Will my
reaction elevate the estimation good people have of me? Will I win
or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win? If I am quiet about it,
will the disagreement blow over? Is this difficult situation an
opportunity for me?
* Bits and Pieces, published by The Economics Press, Fairfield, N.J.
Opera tenor Jan Peerce, after he was married nearly fifty years, once
said: "My wife and I made a pact a long time ago, and we've kept it
no matter how angry we've grown with each other. When one yells,
the other should listen-because when two people yell, there is no
communication, just noise and bad vibrations."

2 - A Sure Way Of Making Enemies -And How To Avoid It
When Theodore Roosevelt was in the White House, he confessed
that if he could be right 75 percent of the time, he would reach the
highest measure of his expectation.
If that was the highest rating that one of the most distinguished men
of the twentieth century could hope to obtain, what about you and
me?
If you can be sure of being right only 55 percent of the time, you can
go down to Wall Street and make a million dollars a day. If you can't
be sure of being right even 55 percent of the time, why should you
tell other people they are wrong?
You can tell people they are wrong by a look or an intonation or a
gesture just as eloquently as you can in words - and if you tell them
they are wrong, do you make them want to agree with you? Never!
For you have struck a direct blow at their intelligence, judgment,
pride and self-respect. That will make them want to strike back. But
it will never make them want to change their minds. You may then
hurl at them all the logic of a Plato or an Immanuel Kant, but you will
not alter their opinions, for you have hurt their feelings.
Never begin by announcing "I am going to prove so-and-so to you."
That's bad. That's tantamount to saying: "I'm smarter than you are,
I'm going to tell you a thing or two and make you change your
mind."
That is a challenge. It arouses opposition and makes the listener
want to battle with you before you even start.
It is difficult, under even the most benign conditions, to change
people's minds. So why make it harder? Why handicap yourself?
If you are going to prove anything, don't let anybody know it. Do it
so subtly, so adroitly, that no one will feel that you are doing it. This
was expressed succinctly by Alexander Pope:
Men must be taught as if you taught them not And things unknown
proposed as things forgot.
Over three hundred years ago Galileo said:
You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it
within himself.
As Lord Chesterfield said to his son:
Be wiser than other people if you can; but do not tell them so.
Socrates said repeatedly to his followers in Athens:
One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing.
Well, I can't hope to be any smarter than Socrates, so I have quit
telling people they are wrong. And I find that it pays.
If a person makes a statement that you think is wrong - yes, even
that you know is wrong - isn't it better to begin by saying: "Well,
now, look, I thought otherwise, but I may be wrong. I frequently
am. And if I am wrong, I want to be put right. Let's examine the
facts."
There's magic, positive magic, in such phrases as: "I may be wrong.
I frequently am. Let's examine the facts."
Nobody in the heavens above or on earth beneath or in the waters
under the earth will ever object to your saying: "I may be wrong.
Let's examine the facts."
One of our class members who used this approach in dealing with
customers was Harold Reinke, a Dodge dealer in Billings, Montana.
He reported that because of the pressures of the automobile
business, he was often hard-boiled and callous when dealing with
customers' complaints. This caused flared tempers, loss of business
and general unpleasantness.
He told his class: "Recognizing that this was getting me nowhere
fast, I tried a new tack. I would say something like this: 'Our
dealership has made so many mistakes that I am frequently
ashamed. We may have erred in your case. Tell me about it.'
"This approach becomes quite disarming, and by the time the
customer releases his feelings, he is usually much more reasonable
when it comes to settling the matter. In fact, several customers have
thanked me for having such an understanding attitude. And two of
them have even brought in friends to buy new cars. In this highly
competitive market, we need more of this type of customer, and I
believe that showing respect for all customers' opinions and treating
them diplomatically and courteously will help beat the competition."
You will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong.
That will stop all argument and inspire your opponent to be just as
fair and open and broad-minded as you are. It will make him want to
admit that he, too, may be wrong.
If you know positively that a person is wrong, and you bluntly tell
him or her so, what happens? Let me illustrate. Mr. S---- a young
New York attorney, once argued a rather important case before the
United States Supreme Court (Lustgarten v. Fleet Corporation 280
U.S. 320). The case involved a considerable sum of money and an
important question of law. During the argument, one of the Supreme
Court justices said to him: "The statute of limitations in admiralty law
is six years, is it not?"
Mr. S---- stopped, stared at the Justice for a moment, and then said
bluntly: "Your Honor, there is no statute of limitations in admiralty."
"A hush fell on the court," said Mr. S---- as he related his experience
to one of the author's classes, "and the temperature in the room
seemed to drop to zero. I was right. Justice - was wrong. And I had
told him so. But did that make him friendly? No. I still believe that I
had the law on my side. And I know that I spoke better than I ever
spoke before. But I didn't persuade. I made the enormous blunder of
telling a very learned and famous man that he was wrong."
Few people are logical. Most of us are prejudiced and biased. Most of
us are blighted with preconceived notions, with jealousy, suspicion,
fear, envy and pride. And most citizens don't want to change their
minds about their religion or their haircut or communism or their
favorite movie star. So, if you are inclined to tell people they are
wrong, please read the following paragraph every morning before
breakfast. It is from James Harvey Robinson's enlightening book The
Mind in the Making.
We sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without any
resistance or heavy emotion, but if we are told we are wrong, we
resent the imputation and harden our hearts. We are incredibly
heedless in the formation of our beliefs, but find ourselves filled with
an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to rob us of their
companionship. It is obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear
to us, but our self-esteem which is threatened. ... The little word
"my" is the most important one in human affairs, and properly to
reckon with it is the beginning of wisdom. It has the same force
whether it is "my" dinner, "my" dog, and "my" house, or "my" father,
"my" country, and "my" God. We not only resent the imputation that
our watch is wrong, or our car shabby, but that our conception of
the canals of Mars, of the pronunciation of "Epictetus," of the
medicinal value of salicin, or of the date of Sargon I is subject to
revision. We like to continue to believe what we have been
accustomed to accept as true, and the resentment aroused when
doubt is cast upon any of our assumptions leads us to seek every
manner of excuse for clinging to it. The result is that most of our socalled
reasoning consists in finding arguments for going on believing
as we already do.
Carl Rogers, the eminent psychologist, wrote in his book On
Becoming a Person:
I have found it of enormous value when I can permit myself to
understand the other person. The way in which I have worded this
statement may seem strange to you, Is it necessary to permit
oneself to understand another? I think it is. Our first reaction to most
of the statements (which we hear from other people) is an
evaluation or judgment, rather than an understanding of it. When
someone expresses some feeling, attitude or belief, our tendency is
almost immediately to feel "that's right," or "that's stupid," "that's
abnormal," "that's unreasonable," "that's incorrect," "that's not nice."
Very rarely do we permit ourselves to understand precisely what the
meaning of the statement is to the other person. (*)

Houghton Mifflin, 1961), pp. 18ff.

I once employed an interior decorator to make some draperies for
my home. When the bill arrived, I was dismayed.
A few days later, a friend dropped in and looked at the draperies.
The price was mentioned, and she exclaimed with a note of triumph:
"What? That's awful. I am afraid he put one over on you."
True? Yes, she had told the truth, but few people like to listen to
truths that reflect on their judgment. So, being human, I tried to
defend myself. I pointed out that the best is eventually the cheapest,
that one can't expect to get quality and artistic taste at bargainbasement
prices, and so on and on.
The next day another friend dropped in, admired the draperies,
bubbled over with enthusiasm, and expressed a wish that she could
afford such exquisite creations for her home. My reaction was totally
different. "Well, to tell the truth," I said, "I can't afford them myself.
I paid too much. I'm sorry I ordered them,"
When we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves. And if we are
handled gently and tactfully, we may admit it to others and even
take pride in our frankness and broad-mindedness. But not if
someone else is trying to ram the unpalatable fact down our
esophagus.
Horace Greeley, the most famous editor in America during the time
of the Civil War, disagreed violently with Lincoln's policies. He
believed that he could drive Lincoln into agreeing with him by a
campaign of argument, ridicule and abuse. He waged this bitter
campaign month after month, year after year. In fact, he wrote a
brutal, bitter, sarcastic and personal attack on President Lincoln the
night Booth shot him.
But did all this bitterness make Lincoln agree with Greeley? Not at
all. Ridicule and abuse never do. If you want some excellent
suggestions about dealing with people and managing yourself and
improving your personality, read Benjamin Franklin's autobiography -
one of the most fascinating life stories ever written, one of the
classics of American literature. Ben Franklin tells how he conquered
the iniquitous habit of argument and transformed himself into one of
the most able, suave and diplomatic men in American history.
One day, when Ben Franklin was a blundering youth, an old Quaker
friend took him aside and lashed him with a few stinging truths,
something like this:
Ben, you are impossible. Your opinions have a slap in them for
everyone who differs with you. They have become so offensive that
nobody cares for them. Your friends find they enjoy themselves
better when you are not around. You know so much that no man can
tell you anything. Indeed, no man is going to try, for the effort would
lead only to discomfort and hard work. So you are not likely ever to
know any more than you do now, which is very little.
One of the finest things I know about Ben Franklin is the way he
accepted that smarting rebuke. He was big enough and wise enough
to realize that it was true, to sense that he was headed for failure
and social disaster. So he made a right-about-face. He began
immediately to change his insolent, opinionated ways.
"I made it a rule," said Franklin, "to forbear all direct contradiction to
the sentiment of others, and all positive assertion of my own, I even
forbade myself the use of every word or expression in the language
that imported a fix'd opinion, such as 'certainly,' 'undoubtedly,' etc.,
and I adopted, instead of them, 'I conceive,' 'I apprehend, ' or 'I
imagine' a thing to be so or so, or 'it so appears to me at present.'
When another asserted something that I thought an error, I deny'd
myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing
immediately some absurdity in his proposition: and in answering I
began by observing that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion
would be right, but in the present case there appear'd or seem'd to
me some difference, etc. I soon found the advantage of this change
in my manner; the conversations I engag'd in went on more
pleasantly. The modest way in which I propos'd my opinions procur'd
them a readier reception and less contradiction; I had less
mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily
prevaile'd with others to give up their mistakes and join with me
when I happened to be in the right.
"And this mode, which I at first put on with some violence to natural
inclination, became at length so easy, and so habitual to me, that
perhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a
dogmatical expression escape me. And to this habit (after my
character of integrity) I think it principally owing that I had earned so
much weight with my fellow citizens when I proposed new
institutions, or alterations in the old, and so much influence in public
councils when I became a member; for I was but a bad speaker,
never eloquent, subject to much hesitation in my choice of words,
hardly correct in language, and yet I generally carried my points."
How do Ben Franklin's methods work in business? Let's take two
examples.
Katherine A, Allred of Kings Mountain, North Carolina, is an industrial
engineering supervisor for a yarn-processing plant. She told one of
our classes how she handled a sensitive problem before and after
taking our training:
"Part of my responsibility," she reported, "deals with setting up and
maintaining incentive systems and standards for our operators so
they can make more money by producing more yarn. The system we
were using had worked fine when we had only two or three different
types of yarn, but recently we had expanded our inventory and
capabilities to enable us to run more than twelve different varieties.
The present system was no longer adequate to pay the operators
fairly for the work being performed and give them an incentive to
increase production. I had worked up a new system which would
enable us to pay the operator by the class of yam she was running at
any one particular time. With my new system in hand, I entered the
meeting determined to prove to the management that my system
was the right approach. I told them in detail how they were wrong
and showed where they were being unfair and how I had all the
answers they needed. To say the least, I failed miserably! I had
become so busy defending my position on the new system that I had
left them no opening to graciously admit their problems on the old
one. The issue was dead.
"After several sessions of this course, I realized all too well where I
had made my mistakes. I called another meeting and this time I
asked where they felt their problems were. We discussed each point,
and I asked them their opinions on which was the best way to
proceed. With a few low-keyed suggestions, at proper intervals, I let
them develop my system themselves. At the end of the meeting
when I actually presented my system, they enthusiastically accepted
it.
"I am convinced now that nothing good is accomplished and a lot of
damage can be done if you tell a person straight out that he or she is
wrong. You only succeed in stripping that person of self-dignity and
making yourself an unwelcome part of any discussion."
Let's take another example - and remember these cases I am citing
are typical of the experiences of thousands of other people. R. V.
Crowley was a salesman for a lumber company in New York. Crowley
admitted that he had been telling hard-boiled lumber inspectors for
years that they were wrong. And he had won the arguments too. But
it hadn't done any good. "For these lumber inspectors," said Mr.
Crowley, "are like baseball umpires. Once they make a decision, they
never change it,"
Mr. Crowley saw that his firm was losing thousands of dollars
through the arguments he won. So while taking my course, he
resolved to change tactics and abandon arguments. With what
results? Here is the story as he told it to the fellow members of his
class:
"One morning the phone rang in my office. A hot and bothered
person at the other end proceeded to inform me that a car of lumber
we had shipped into his plant was entirely unsatisfactory. His firm
had stopped unloading and requested that we make immediate
arrangements to remove the stock from their yard. After about onefourth
of the car had been unloaded, their lumber inspector reported
that the lumber was running 55 percent below grade. Under the
circumstances, they refused to accept it.
"I immediately started for his plant and on the way turned over in
my mind the best way to handle the situation. Ordinarily, under such
circumstances, I should have quoted grading rules and tried, as a
result of my own experience and knowledge as a lumber inspector,
to convince the other inspector that the lumber was actually up to
grade, and that he was misinterpreting the rules in his inspection.
However, I thought I would apply the principles learned in this
training.
"When I arrived at the plant, I found the purchasing agent and the
lumber inspector in a wicked humor, both set for an argument and a
fight. We walked out to the car that was being unloaded, and I
requested that they continue to unload so that I could see how
things were going. I asked the inspector to go right ahead and lay
out the rejects, as he had been doing, and to put the good pieces in
another pile.
"After watching him for a while it began to dawn on me that his
inspection actually was much too strict and that he was
misinterpreting the rules. This particular lumber was white pine, and
I knew the inspector was
thoroughly schooled in hard woods but not a competent,
experienced inspector on white pine. White pine happened to be my
own strong suit, but did I offer any objection to the way he was
grading the lumber? None whatever. I kept on watching and
gradually began to ask questions as to why certain pieces were not
satisfactory. I didn't for one instant insinuate that the inspector was
wrong. I emphasized that my only reason for asking was in order
that we could give his firm exactly what they wanted in future
shipments. wanted in future shipments.
"By asking questions in a very friendly, cooperative spirit, and
insisting continually that they were right in laying out boards not
satisfactory to their purpose, I got him warmed up, and the strained
relations between us began to thaw and melt away. An occasional
carefully put remark on my part gave birth to the idea in his mind
that possibly some of these rejected pieces were actually within the
grade that they had bought, and that their requirements demanded
a more expensive grade. I was very careful, however, not to let him
think I was making an issue of this point.
"Gradually his whole attitude changed. He finally admitted to me that
he was not experienced on white pine and began to ask me
questions about each piece as it came out of the car, I would explain
why such a piece came within the grade specified, but kept on
insisting that we did not want him to take it if it was unsuitable for
their purpose. He finally got to the point where he felt guilty every
time he put a piece in the rejected pile. And at last he saw that the
mistake was on their part for not having specified as good a grade as
they needed.
"The ultimate outcome was that he went through the entire carload
again after I left, accepted the whole lot, and we received a check in
full.
"In that one instance alone, a little tact, and the determination to
refrain from telling the other man he was wrong, saved my company
a substantial amount of cash, and it would be hard to place a money
value on the good will that was saved."
Martin Luther King was asked how, as a pacifist, he could be an
admirer of Air Force General Daniel "Chappie" James, then the
nation's highest-ranking black officer. Dr. King replied, "I judge
people by their own principles - not by my own."
In a similar way, General Robert E. Lee once spoke to the president
of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, in the most glowing terms about
a certain officer under his command. Another officer in attendance
was astonished. "General," he said, " do you not know that the man
of whom you speak so highly is one of your bitterest enemies who
misses no opportunity to malign you?" "Yes," replied General Lee,
"but the president asked my opinion of him; he did not ask for his
opinion of me."
By the way, I am not revealing anything new in this chapter. Two
thousand years ago, Jesus said: "Agree with thine adversary
quickly."
And 2,200 years before Christ was born, King Akhtoi of Egypt gave
his son some shrewd advice - advice that is sorely needed today. "Be
diplomatic," counseled the King. "It will help you gain your point."
In other words, don't argue with your customer or your spouse or
your adversary. Don't tell them they are wrong, don't get them
stirred up. Use a little diplomacy.
? Principle 2 - Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never
say, "You're wrong."

3 - If You're Wrong, Admit It
Within a minute's walk of my house there was a wild stretch of virgin
timber, where the blackberry thickets foamed white in the
springtime, where the squirrels nested and reared their young, and
the horseweeds grew as tall as a horse's head. This unspoiled
woodland was called Forest Park - and it was a forest, probably not
much different in appearance from what it was when Columbus
discovered America. I frequently walked in this park with Rex, my
little Boston bulldog. He was a friendly, harmless little hound; and
since we rarely met anyone in the park, I took Rex along without a
leash or a muzzle.
One day we encountered a mounted policeman in the park, a
policeman itching to show his authority.
"'What do you mean by letting that dog run loose in the park without
a muzzle and leash?" he reprimanded me. "Don't you know it's
against the law?"
"Yes, I know it is," I replied softy, "but I didn't think he would do any
harm out here."
"You didn't think! You didn't think! The law doesn't give a tinker's
damn about what you think. That dog might kill a squirrel or bite a
child. Now, I'm going to let you off this time; but if I catch this dog
out here again without a muzzle and a leash, you'll have to tell it to
the judge ."
I meekly promised to obey.
And I did obey - for a few times. But Rex didn't like the muzzle, and
neither did I; so we decided to take a chance. Everything was lovely
for a while, and then we struck a snag. Rex and I raced over the
brow of a hill one afternoon and there, suddenly - to my dismay - I
saw the majesty of the law, astride a bay horse. Rex was out in
front, heading straight for the officer.
I was in for it. I knew it. So I didn't wait until the policeman started
talking. I beat him to it. I said: "Officer, you've caught me redhanded.
I'm guilty. I have no alibis, no excuses. You warned me last
week that if I brought the dog out here again without a muzzle you
would fine me."
"Well, now," the policeman responded in a soft tone. "I know it's a
temptation to let a little dog like that have a run out here when
nobody is around."
"Sure it's a temptation," I replied, "but it is against the law."
"Well, a little dog like that isn't going to harm anybody," the
policeman remonstrated.
"No, but he may kill squirrels," I said.
"Well now, I think you are taking this a bit too seriously," he told me.
"I'll tell you what you do. You just let him run over the hill there
where I can't see him - and we'll forget all about it."
That policeman, being human, wanted a feeling of importance; so
when I began to condemn myself, the only way he could nourish his
self-esteem was to take the magnanimous attitude of showing
mercy.
But suppose I had tried to defend myself - well, did you ever argue
with a policeman?
But instead of breaking lances with him, I admitted that he was
absolutely right and I was absolutely wrong; I admitted it quickly,
openly, and with enthusiasm. The affair terminated graciously in my
taking his side and his taking my side. Lord Chesterfield himself
could hardly have been more gracious than this mounted policeman,
who, only a week previously, had threatened to have the law on me.
If we know we are going to be rebuked anyhow, isn't it far better to
beat the other person to it and do it ourselves? Isn't it much easier
to listen to self-criticism than to bear condemnation from alien lips?
Say about yourself all the derogatory things you know the other
person is thinking or wants to say or intends to say - and say them
before that person has a chance to say them. The chances are a
hundred to one that a generous, forgiving attitude will be taken and
your mistakes will be minimized just as the mounted policeman did
with me and Rex.
Ferdinand E. Warren, a commercial artist, used this technique to win
the good will of a petulant, scolding buyer of art.
"It is important, in making drawings for advertising and publishing
purposes, to be precise and very exact," Mr. Warren said as he told
the story.
"Some art editors demand that their commissions be executed
immediately; and in these cases, some slight error is liable to occur. I
knew one art director in particular who was always delighted to find
fault with some little thing. I have often left his office in disgust, not
because of the criticism, but because of his method of attack.
Recently I delivered a rush job to this editor, and he phoned me to
call at his office immediately. He said something was wrong. When I
arrived, I found just what I had anticipated - and dreaded. He was
hostile, gloating over his chance to criticize. He demanded with heat
why I had done so and so. My opportunity had come to apply the
self-criticism I had been studying about. So I said: ''Mr. So-and-so, if
what you say is true, I am at fault and there is absolutely no excuse
for my blunder. I have been doing drawings for you long enough to
know bet-ter. I'm ashamed of myself.'
"Immediately he started to defend me. 'Yes, you're right, but after
all, this isn't a serious mistake. It is only -'
"I interrupted him. 'Any mistake,' I said, 'may be costly and they are
all irritating.'
"He started to break in, but I wouldn't let him. I was having a grand
time. For the first time in my life, I was criticizing myself - and I
loved it.
" 'I should have been more careful,' I continued. 'You give me a lot
of work, and you deserve the best; so I'm going to do this drawing
all over.'
" 'No! No!' he protested. 'I wouldn't think of putting you to all that
trouble.' He praised my work, assured me that he wanted only a
minor change and that my slight error hadn't cost his firm any
money; and, after all, it was a mere detail - not worth worrying
about.
"My eagerness to criticize myself took all the fight out of him. He
ended up by taking me to lunch; and before we parted, he gave me
a check and another commission"
There is a certain degree of satisfaction in having the courage to
admit one's errors. It not only clears the air of guilt and
defensiveness, but often helps solve the problem created by the
error.
Bruce Harvey of Albuquerque, New Mexico, had incorrectly
authorized payment of full wages to an employee on sick leave.
When he discovered his error, he brought it to the attention of the
employee and explained that to correct the mistake he would have to
reduce his next paycheck by the entire amount of the overpayment.
The employee pleaded that as that would cause him a serious
financial problem, could the money be repaid over a period of time?
In order to do this, Harvey explained, he would have to obtain his
supervisor's approval. "And this I knew," reported Harvey, "would
result in a boss-type explosion, While trying to decide how to handle
this situation better, I realized that the whole mess was my fault and
I would have to admit I it to my boss.
"I walked into his office, told him that I had made a mistake and
then informed him of the complete facts. He replied in an explosive
manner that it was the fault of the personnel department. I repeated
that it was my fault. He exploded again about carelessness in the
accounting department. Again I explained it was my fault. He blamed
two other people in the office. But each time I reiterated it was my
fault. Finally, he looked at me and said, 'Okay, it was your fault. Now
straighten it out.' The error was corrected and nobody got into
trouble. I felt great because I was able to handle a tense situation
and had the courage not to seek alibis. My boss has had more
respect for me ever since."
Any fool can try to defend his or her mistakes - and most fools do -
but it raises one above the herd and gives one a feeling of nobility
and exultation to admit one's mistakes. For example, one of the most
beautiful things that history records about Robert E. Lee is the way
he blamed himself and only himself for the failure of Pickett's charge
at Gettysburg.
Pickett's charge was undoubtedly the most brilliant and picturesque
attack that ever occurred in the Western world. General George E.
Pickett himself was picturesque. He wore his hair so long that his
auburn locks almost touched his shoulders; and, like Napoleon in his
Italian campaigns, he wrote ardent love-letters almost daily while on
the battlefield. His devoted troops cheered him that tragic July
afternoon as he rode off jauntily toward the Union lines, his cap set
at a rakish angle over his right ear. They cheered and they followed
him, man touching man, rank pressing rank, with banners flying and
bayonets gleaming in the sun. It was a gallant sight. Daring.
Magnificent. A murmur of admiration ran through the Union lines as
they beheld it.
Pickett's troops swept forward at any easy trot, through orchard and
cornfield, across a meadow and over a ravine. All the time, the
enemy's cannon was tearing ghastly holes in their ranks, But on they
pressed, grim, irresistible.
Suddenly the Union infantry rose from behind the stone wall on
Cemetery Ridge where they had been hiding and fired volley after
volley into Pickett's onrushing troops. The crest of the hill was a
sheet of flame, a slaughterhouse, a blazing volcano. In a few
minutes, all of Pickett's brigade commanders except one were down,
and four-fifths of his five thousand men had fallen.
General Lewis A. Armistead, leading the troops in the final plunge,
ran forward, vaulted over the stone wall, and, waving his cap on the
top of his sword, shouted: "Give 'em the steel, boys!"
They did. They leaped over the wall, bayoneted their enemies,
smashed skulls with clubbed muskets, and planted the battleflags of
the South on Cemetery Ridge. The banners waved there only for a
moment. But that moment, brief as it was, recorded the high-water
mark of the Confederacy.
Pickett's charge - brilliant, heroic - was nevertheless the beginning of
the end. Lee had failed. He could not penetrate the North. And he
knew it.
The South was doomed.
Lee was so saddened, so shocked, that he sent in his resignation and
asked Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, to appoint
"a younger and abler man." If Lee had wanted to blame the
disastrous failure of Pickett's charge on someone else, he could have
found a score of alibis. Some of his division commanders had failed
him. The cavalry hadn't arrived in time to support the infantry attack.
This had gone wrong and that had gone awry.
But Lee was far too noble to blame others. As Pickett's beaten and
bloody troops struggled back to the Confederate lines, Robert E. Lee
rode out to meet them all alone and greeted them with a selfcondemnation
that was little short of sublime. "All this has been my
fault," he confessed. "I and I alone have lost this battle."
Few generals in all history have had the courage and character to
admit that.
Michael Cheung, who teaches our course in Hong Kong, told of how
the Chinese culture presents some special problems and how
sometimes it is necessary to recognize that the benefit of applying a
principle may be more advantageous than maintaining an old
tradition. He had one middle-aged class member who had been
estranged from his son for many years. The father had been an
opium addict, but was now cured. In Chinese tradition an older
person cannot take the first step. The father felt that it was up to his
son to take the initiative toward a reconciliation. In an early session,
he told the class about the grandchildren he had never seen and how
much he desired to be reunited with his son. His classmates, all
Chinese, understood his conflict between his desire and longestablished
tradition. The father felt that young people should have
respect for their elders and that he was right in not giving in to his
desire, but to wait for his son to come to him.
Toward the end of the course the father again addressed his class. "I
have pondered this problem," he said. "Dale Carnegie says, 'If you
are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.' It is too late for me to
admit it quickly, but I can admit it emphatically. I wronged my son.
He was right in not wanting to see me and to expel me from his life.
I may lose face by asking a younger person's forgiveness, but I was
at fault and it is my responsibility to admit this." The class applauded
and gave him their full support. At the next class he told how he
went to his son's house, asked for and received forgiveness and was
now embarked on a new relationship with his son, his daughter-inlaw
and the grandchildren he had at last met.
Elbert Hubbard was one of the most original authors who ever stirred
up a nation, and his stinging sentences often aroused fierce
resentment. But Hubbard with his rare skill for handling people
frequently turned his enemies into friends.
For example, when some irritated reader wrote in to say that he
didn't agree with such and such an article and ended by calling
Hubbard this and that, Elbert Hubbard would answer like this:
Come to think it over, I don't entirely agree with it myself. Not
everything I wrote yesterday appeals to me today. I am glad to learn
what you think on the subject. The next time you are in the
neighborhood you must visit us and we'll get this subject threshed
out for all time. So here is a handclasp over the miles, and I am,
Yours sincerely,
What could you say to a man who treated you like that?
When we are right, let's try to win people gently and tactfully to our
way of thinking, and when we are wrong - and that will be
surprisingly often, if we are honest with ourselves - let's admit our
mistakes quickly and with enthusiasm. Not only will that technique
produce astonishing results; but, believe it or not, it is a lot more
fun, under the circumstances, than trying to defend oneself.
Remember the old proverb: "By fighting you never get enough, but
by yielding you get more than you expected."
? Principle 3 - If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.

4 - A Drop Of Honey
If your temper is aroused and you tell 'em a thing or two, you will
have a fine time unloading your feelings. But what about the other
person? Will he share your pleasure? Will your belligerent tones, your
hostile attitude, make it easy for him to agree with you?
"If you come at me with your fists doubled," said Woodrow Wilson,
"I think I can promise you that mine will double as fast as yours; but
if you come to me and say, 'Let us sit down and take counsel
together, and, if we differ from each other, understand why it is that
we differ, just what the points at issue are,' we will presently find
that we are not so far apart after all, that the points on which we
differ are few and the points on which we agree are many, and that
if we only have the patience and the candor and the desire to get
together, we will get together."
Nobody appreciated the truth of Woodrow Wilson's statement more
than John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Back in 1915, Rockefeller was the most
fiercely despised man in Colorado, One of the bloodiest strikes in the
history of American industry had been shocking the state for two
terrible years. Irate, belligerent miners were demanding higher
wages from the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company; Rockefeller
controlled that company. Property had been destroyed, troops had
been called out. Blood had been shed. Strikers had been shot, their
bodies riddled with bullets.
At a time like that, with the air seething with hatred, Rockefeller
wanted to win the strikers to his way of thinking. And he did it. How?
Here's the story. After weeks spent in making friends, Rockefeller
addressed the representatives of the strikers. This speech, in its
entirety, is a masterpiece. It produced astonishing results. It calmed
the tempestuous waves of hate that threatened to engulf
Rockefeller. It won him a host of admirers. It presented facts in such
a friendly manner that the strikers went back to work without saying
another word about the increase in wages for which they had fought
so violently.
The opening of that remarkable speech follows. Note how it fairly
glows with friendliness. Rockefeller, remember, was talking to men
who, a few days previously, had wanted to hang him by the neck to
a sour apple tree; yet he couldn't have been more gracious, more
friendly if he had addressed a group of medical missionaries. His
speech was radiant with such phrases as I am proud to be here,
having visited in your homes, met many of your wives and children,
we meet here not as strangers, but as friends ... spirit of mutual
friendship, our common interests, it is only by your courtesy that I
am here.
"This is a red-letter day in my life," Rockefeller began. "It is the first
time I have ever had the good fortune to meet the representatives of
the employees of this great company, its officers and
superintendents, together, and I can assure you that I am proud to
be here, and that I shall remember this gathering as long as I live.
Had this meeting been held two weeks ago, I should have stood here
a stranger to most of you, recognizing a few faces. Having had the
opportunity last week of visiting all the camps in the southern coal
field and of talking individually with practically all of the
representatives, except those who were away; having visited in your
homes, met many of your wives and children, we meet here not as
strangers, but as friends, and it is in that spirit of mutual friendship
that I am glad to have this opportunity to discuss with you our
common interests.
"Since this is a meeting of the officers of the company and the
representatives of the employees, it is only by your courtesy that I
am here, for I am not so fortunate as to be either one or the other;
and yet I feel that I am intimately associated with you men, for, in a
sense, I represent both the stockholders and the directors."
Isn't that a superb example of the fine art of making friends out of
enemies?
Suppose Rockefeller had taken a different tack. Suppose he had
argued with those miners and hurled devastating facts in their faces.
Suppose he had told them by his tones and insinuations that they
were wrong Suppose that, by all the rules of logic, he had proved
that they were wrong. What would have happened? More anger
would have been stirred up, more hatred, more revolt.
If a man's heart is rankling with discord and ill feeling toward you,
you can't win him to your way of thinking with all the logic in
Christendom. Scolding parents and domineering bosses and
husbands and nagging wives ought to realize that people don't want
to change their minds. They can't he forced or driven to agree with
you or me. But they may possibly be led to, if we are gentle and
friendly, ever so gentle and ever so friendly.
Lincoln said that, in effect, over a hundred years ago. Here are his
words:
It is an old and true maxim that "a drop of honey catches more flies
than a gallon of gall." So with men, if you would win a man to you
cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a
drop of honey that catches his heart; which, say what you will, is the
great high road to his reason.
Business executives have learned that it pays to be friendly to
strikers. For example, when 2,500 employees in the White Motor
Company's plant struck for higher wages and a union shop, Robert F.
Black, then president of the company, didn't lose his temper and
condemn and threaten and talk of tryanny and Communists. He
actually praised the strikers. He published an advertisement in the
Cleveland papers, complimenting them on "the peaceful way in
which they laid down their tools." Finding the strike pickets idle, he
bought them a couple of dozen baseball bats and gloves and invited
them to play ball on vacant lots. For those who preferred bowling, he
rented a bowling alley.
This friendliness on Mr. Black's part did what friendliness always
does: it begot friendliness. So the strikers borrowed brooms, shovels,
and rubbish carts, and began picking up matches, papers, cigarette
stubs, and cigar butts around the factory. Imagine it! Imagine
strikers tidying up the factory grounds while battling for higher
wages and recognition of the union. Such an event had never been
heard of before in the long, tempestuous history of American labor
wars. That strike ended with a compromise settlement within a
week-ended without any ill feeling or rancor.
Daniel Webster, who looked like a god and talked like Jehovah, was
one of the most successful advocates who ever pleaded a case; yet
he ushered in his most powerful arguments with such friendly
remarks as: "It will be for the jury to consider," "This may perhaps
be worth thinking of," " Here are some facts that I trust you will not
lose sight of," or "You, with your knowledge of human nature, will
easily see the significance of these facts." No bulldozing. No highpressure
methods. No attempt to force his opinions on others.
Webster used the soft-spoken, quiet, friendly approach, and it helped
to make him famous.
You may never be called upon to settle a strike or address a jury, but
you may want to get your rent reduced. Will the friendly approach
help you then? Let's see.
0. L. Straub, an engineer, wanted to get his rent reduced. And he
knew his landlord was hard-boiled. "I wrote him," Mr. Straub said in
a speech before the class, "notifying him that I was vacating my
apartment as soon as my lease expired. The truth was, I didn't want
to move. I wanted to stay if I could get my rent reduced. But the
situation seemed hopeless. Other tenants had tried - and failed.
Everyone told me that the landlord was extremely difficult to deal
with. But I said to myself, 'I am studying a course in how to deal
with people, so I'll try it on him - and see how it works.'
"He and his secretary came to see me as soon as he got my letter. I
met him at the door with a friendly greeting. I fairly bubbled with
good will and enthusiasm. I didn't begin talking about how high the
rent was. I began talking about how much I liked his apartment
house. Believe me, I was 'hearty in my approbation and lavish in my
praise.' I complimented him on the way he ran the building and told
him I should like so much to stay for another year but I couldn't
afford it.
"He had evidently never had such a reception from a tenant. He
hardly knew what to make of it.
"Then he started to tell me his troubles. Complaining tenants. One
had written him fourteen letters, some of them positively insulting.
Another threatened to break his lease unless the landlord kept the
man on the floor above from snoring. 'What a relief it is,' he said, 'to
have a satisfied tenant like you.' And then, without my even asking
him to do it, he offered to reduce my rent a little. I wanted more, so
I named the figure I could afford to pay, and he accepted without a
word.
"As he was leaving, he turned to me and asked, 'What decorating
can I do for you?'
"If I had tried to get the rent reduced by the methods the other
tenants were using, I am positive I should have met with the same
failure they encountered. It was the friendly, sympathetic,
appreciative approach that won."
Dean Woodcock of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is the superintendent of
a department of the local electric company. His staff was called upon
to repair some equipment on top of a pole. This type of work had
formerly been performed by a different department and had only
recently been transferred to Woodcock's section Although his people
had been trained in the work, this was the first time they had ever
actually been called upon to do it. Everybody in the organization was
interested in seeing if and how they could handle it. Mr. Woodcock,
several of his subordinate managers, and members of other
departments of the utility went to see the operation. Many cars and
trucks were there, and a number of people were standing around
watching the two lone men on top of the pole.
Glancing around, Woodcock noticed a man up the street getting out
of his car with a camera. He began taking pictures of the scene.
Utility people are extremely conscious of public relations, and
suddenly Woodcock realized what this setup looked like to the man
with the camera - overkill, dozens of people being called out to do a
two-person job. He strolled up the street to the photographer.
"I see you're interested in our operation."
"Yes, and my mother will be more than interested. She owns stock in
your company. This will be an eye-opener for her. She may even
decide her investment was unwise. I've been telling her for years
there's a lot of waste motion in companies like yours. This proves it.
The newspapers might like these pictures, too."
"It does look like it, doesn't it? I'd think the same thing in your
position. But this is a unique situation, . . ." and Dean Woodcock
went on to explain how this was the first job of this type for his
department and how everybody from executives down was
interested. He assured the man that under normal conditions two
people could handle the job. The photographer put away his camera,
shook Woodcock's hand, and thanked him for taking the time to
explain the situation to him.
Dean Woodcock's friendly approach saved his company much
embarrassment and bad publicity.
Another member of one of our classes, Gerald H. Winn of Littleton,
New Hampshire, reported how by using a friendly approach, he
obtained a very satisfactory settlement on a damage claim.
"Early in the spring," he reported, "before the ground had thawed
from the winter freezing, there was an unusually heavy rainstorm
and the water, which normally would have run off to nearby ditches
and storm drains along the road, took a new course onto a building
lot where I had just built a new home.
"Not being able to run off, the water pressure built up around the
foundation of the house. The water forced itself under the concrete
basement floor, causing it to explode, and the basement filled with
water. This ruined the furnace and the hot-water heater. The cost to
repair this damage was in excess of two thousand dollars. I had no
insurance to cover this type of damage.
"However, I soon found out that the owner of the subdivision had
neglected to put in a storm drain near the house which could have
prevented this problem I made an appointment to see him. During
the twenty-five-mile trip to his office, I carefully reviewed the
situation and, remembering the principles I learned in this course, I
decided that showing my anger would not serve any worthwhile
purpose, When I arrived, I kept very calm and started by talking
about his recent vacation to the West Indies; then, when I felt the
timing was right, I mentioned the 'little' problem of water damage.
He quickly agreed to do his share in helping to correct the problem.
"A few days later he called and said he would pay for the damage
and also put in a storm drain to prevent the same thing from
happening in the future.
"Even though it was the fault of the owner of the subdivision, if I had
not begun in a friendly way, there would have been a great deal of
difficulty in getting him to agree to the total liability."
Years ago, when I was a barefoot boy walking through the woods to
a country school out in northwest Missouri, I read a fable about the
sun and the wind. They quarreled about which was the stronger, and
the wind said, "I'll prove I am. See the old man down there with a
coat? I bet I can get his coat off him quicker than you can."
So the sun went behind a cloud, and the wind blew until it was
almost a tornado, but the harder it blew, the tighter the old man
clutched his coat to him.
Finally, the wind calmed down and gave up, and then the sun came
out from behind the clouds and smiled kindly on the old man.
Presently, he mopped his brow and pulled off his coat. The sun then
told the wind that gentleness and friendliness were always stronger
than fury and force.
The use of gentleness and friendliness is demonstrated day after day
by people who have learned that a drop of honey catches more flies
than a gallon of gall. F. Gale Connor of Lutherville, Maryland, proved
this when he had to take his four-month-old car to the service
department of the car dealer for the third time. He told our class: "It
was apparent that talking to, reasoning with or shouting at the
service manager was not going to lead to a satisfactory resolution of
my problems.
"I walked over to the showroom and asked to see the agency owner,
Mr. White. After a short wait, I was ushered into Mr. White's office. I
introduced myself and explained to him that I had bought my car
from his dealership because of the recommendations of friends who
had had previous dealings with him. I was told that his prices were
very competitive and his service was outstanding. He smiled with
satisfaction as he listened to me. I then explained the problem I was
having with the service department. 'I thought you might want to be
aware of any situation that might tarnish your fine reputation,' I
added. He thanked me for calling this to his attention and assured
me that my problem would be taken care of. Not only did he
personal get involved, but he also lent me his car to use while mine
was being repaired."
Aesop was a Greek slave who lived at the court of Croesus and spun
immortal fables six hundred years before Christ. Yet the truths he
taught about human nature are just as true in Boston and
Birmingham now as they were twenty-six centuries ago in Athens.
The sun can make you take off your coat more quickly than the
wind; and kindliness, the friendly approach and appreciation can
make people change their minds more readily than all the bluster
and storming in the world.
Remember what Lincoln said: "A drop of honey catches more flies
than a gallon of gall."

5 - The Secret Of Socrates
In talking with people, don't begin by discussing the things on which
you differ. Begin by emphasizing - and keep on emphasizing - the
things on which you agree. Keep emphasizing, if possible, that you
are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is
one of method and not of purpose.
Get the other person saying "Yes, yes" at the outset. Keep your
opponent, if possible, from saying "No." A "No" response, according
to Professor Overstreet, (*) is a most difficult handicap to overcome.
When you have said "No," all your pride of personality demands that
you remain consistent with yourself. You may later feel that the "No"
was ill-advised; nevertheless, there is your precious pride to
consider! Once having said a thing, you feel you must stick to it.
Hence it is of the very greatest importance that a person be started
in the affirmative direction.
----
[*] Harry A. Overstreet, lnfluencing Humun Behavior (New York:
Norton, 1925).
----
The skillful speaker gets, at the outset, a number of "Yes" responses.
This sets the psychological process of the listeners moving in the
affirmative direction. It is like the movement of a billiard ball. Propel
in one direction, and it takes some force to deflect it; far more force
to send it back in the opposite direction.
The psychological patterns here are quite clear. When a person says
"No" and really means it, he or she is doing far more than saying a
word of two letters. The entire organism - glandular, nervous,
muscular -gathers itself together into a condition of rejection. There
is, usually in minute but sometimes in observable degree, a physical
withdrawal or readiness for withdrawal. The whole neuromuscular
system, in short, sets itself on guard against acceptance. When, to
the contrary, a person says "Yes," none of the withdrawal activities
takes place. The organism is in a forward - moving, accepting, open
attitude. Hence the more "Yeses" we can, at the very outset, induce,
the more likely we are to succeed in capturing the attention for our
ultimate proposal.
It is a very simple technique - this yes response. And yet, how much
it is neglected! It often seems as if people get a sense of their own
importance by antagonizing others at the outset.
Get a student to say "No" at the beginning, or a customer, child,
husband, or wife, and it takes the wisdom and the patience of angels
to transform that bristling negative into an affirmative.
The use of this "yes, yes" technique enabled James Eberson, who
was a teller in the Greenwich Savings Bank, in New York City, to
secure a prospective customer who might otherwise have been lost.
"This man came in to open an account," said Mr. Eberson, "and I
gave him our usual form to fill out. Some of the questions he
answered willingly, but there were others he flatly refused to answer.
"Before I began the study of human relations, I would have told this
prospective depositor that if he refused to give the bank this
information, we should have to refuse to accept this account. I am
ashamed that I have been guilty of doing that very thing in the past.
Naturally, an ultimatum like that made me feel good. I had shown
who was boss, that the bank's rules and regulations couldn't be
flouted. But that sort of attitude certainly didn't give a feeling of
welcome and importance to the man who had walked in to give us
his patronage.
"I resolved this morning to use a little horse sense. I resolved not to
talk about what the bank wanted but about what the customer
wanted. And above all else, I was determined to get him saying 'yes,
yes' from the very start. So I agreed with him. I told him the
information he refused to give was not absolutely necessary.
" 'However,' I said, 'suppose you have money in this bank at your
death. Wouldn't you like to have the bank transfer it to your next of
kin, who is entitled to it according to law?'
" 'Yes, of course,' he replied.
" 'Don't you think,' I continued, 'that it would be a good idea to give
us the name of your next of kin so that, in the event of your death,
we could carry out your wishes without error or delay?'
"Again he said, 'Yes.'
"The young man's attitude softened and changed when he realized
that we weren't asking for this information for our sake but for his
sake. Before leaving the bank, this young man not only gave me
complete information about himself but he opened, at my
suggestion, a trust account, naming his mother as the beneficiary for
his account, and he had gladly answered all the questions concerning
his mother also.
"I found that by getting him to say 'yes, yes' from the outset, he
forgot the issue at stake and was happy to do all the things I
suggested."
Joseph Allison, a sales representative for Westinghouse Electric
Company, had this story to tell: "There was a man in my territory
that our company was most eager to sell to. My predecessor had
called on him for ten years without selling anything When I took over
the territory, I called steadily for three years without getting an
order. Finally, after thirteen years of calls and sales talk, we sold him
a few motors. If these proved to be all right, an order for several
hundred more would follow. Such was my expectation,
"Right? I knew they would be all right. So when I called three weeks
later, I was in high spirits.
"The chief engineer greeted me with this shocking announcement:
'Allison, I can't buy the remainder of the motors from you.'
" 'Why?' I asked in amazement. 'Why?'
" 'Because your motors are too hot. I can't put my hand on them,'
"I knew it wouldn't do any good to argue. I had tried that sort of
thing too long. So I thought of getting the 'yes, yes' response.
" 'Well, now look, Mr. Smith,' I said. 'I agree with you a hundred
percent; if those motors are running too hot, you ought not to buy
any more of them. You must have motors that won't run any hotter
than standards set by the National Electrical Manufacturers
Association. Isn't that so?'
"He agreed it was. I had gotten my first 'yes.'
" 'The Electrical Manufacturers Association regulations say that a
properly designed motor may have a temperature of 72 degrees
Fahrenheit above room temperature. Is that correct?'
" 'Yes,' he agreed. 'That's quite correct. But your motors are much
hotter.'
"I didn't argue with him. I merely asked: 'How hot is the mill room?'
" 'Oh,' he said, 'about 75 degrees Fahrenheit.'
" 'Well,' I replied, 'if the mill room is 75 degrees and you add 72 to
that, that makes a total of 147 degrees Fahrenheit. Wouldn't you
scald your hand if you held it under a spigot of hot water at a
temperature of 147 degrees Fahrenheit?'
"Again he had to say 'yes.'
" 'Well,' I suggested, 'wouldn't it he a good idea to keep your hands
off those motors?'
" 'Well, I guess you're right,' he admitted. We continued to chat for a
while. Then he called his secretary and lined up approximately
$35,000 worth of business for the ensuing month.
"It took me years and cost me countless thousands of dollars in lost
business before I finally learned that it doesn't pay to argue, that it is
much more profitable and much more interesting to look at things
from the other person's viewpoint and try to get that person saying
'yes, yes.' "
Eddie Snow, who sponsors our courses in Oakland, California, tells
how he became a good customer of a shop because the proprietor
got him to say "yes, yes." Eddie had become interested in bow
hunting and had spent considerable money in purchasing equipment
and supplies from a local bow store. When his brother was visiting
him he wanted to rent a bow for him from this store. The sales clerk
told him they didn't rent bows, so Eddie phoned another bow store.
Eddie described what happened:
"A very pleasant gentleman answered the phone. His response to my
question for a rental was completely different from the other place.
He said he was sorry but they no longer rented bows because they
couldn't afford to do so. He then asked me if I had rented before. I
replied, 'Yes, several years ago.' He reminded me that I probably
paid $25 to $30 for the rental. I said 'yes' again. He then asked if I
was the kind of person who liked to save money. Naturally, I
answered 'yes.' He went on to explain that they had bow sets with all
the necessary equipment on sale for $34.95. I could buy a complete
set for only $4.95 more than I could rent one. He explained that is
why they had discontinued renting them. Did I think that was
reasonable? My 'yes' response led to a purchase of the set, and
when I picked it up I purchased several more items at this shop and
have since become a regular customer."
Socrates, "the gadfly of Athens," was one of the greatest
philosophers the world has ever known. He did something that only a
handful of men in all history have been able to do: he sharply
changed the whole course of human thought; and now, twenty-four
centuries after his death, he is honored as one of the wisest
persuaders who ever influenced this wrangling world.
His method? Did he tell people they were wrong? Oh, no, not
Socrates. He was far too adroit for that. His whole technique, now
called the "Socratic method," was based upon getting a "yes, yes"
response. He asked questions with which his opponent would have
to agree. He kept on winning one admission after another until he
had an armful of yeses. He kept on asking questions until finally,
almost without realizing it, his opponents found themselves
embracing a conclusion they would have bitterly denied a few
minutes previously.
The next time we are tempted to tell someone he or she is wrong,
let's remember old Socrates and ask a gentle question - a question
that will get the "yes, yes" response.
The Chinese have a proverb pregnant with the age-old wisdom of
the Orient: "He who treads softly goes far."
They have spent five thousand years studying human nature, those
cultured Chinese, and they have garnered a lot of perspicacity: "He
who treads softly goes far."
? Principle 5 - Get the other person saying "yes, yes" immediately.
~~~~~~~
6 - The Safety Valve In Handling Complaints
Must people trying to win others to their way of thinking do too
much talking themselves. Let the other people talk themselves out.
They know more about their business and problems than you do. So
ask them questions. Let them tell you a few things.
If you disagree with them you may be tempted to interrupt. But
don't. It is dangerous. They won't pay attention to you while they
still have a lot of ideas of their own crying for expression. So listen
patiently and with an open mind. Be sincere about it. Encourage
them to express their ideas fully.
Does this policy pay in business? Let's see. Here is the story of a
sales representative who was forced to try it.
One of the largest automobile manufacturers in the United States
was negotiating for a year's requirements of upholstery fabrics.
Three important manufacturers had worked up fabrics in sample
bodies. These had all been inspected by the executives of the motor
company, and notice had been sent to each manufacturer saying
that, on a certain day, a representative from each supplier would be
given an opportunity to make a final plea for the contract.
G.B.R., a representative of one manufacturer, arrived in town with a
severe attack of laryngitis. "When it came my turn to meet the
executives in conference," Mr. R---- said as he related the story
before one of my classes, "I had lost my voice. I could hardly
whisper. I was ushered into a room and found myself face to face
with the textile engineer, the purchasing agent, the director of sales
and the president of the company. I stood up and made a valiant
effort to speak, but I couldn't do anything more than squeak.
"They were all seated around a table, so I wrote on a pad of paper:
'Gentlemen, I have lost my voice. I am speechless.'
" 'I'll do the talking for you,' the president said. He did. He exhibited
my samples and praised their good points. A lively discussion arose
about the merits of my goods. And the president, since he was
talking for me, took the position I would have had during the
discussion My sole participation consisted of smiles, nods and a few
gestures.
"As a result of this unique conference, I was awarded the contract,
which called for over half a million yards of upholstery fabrics at an
aggregate value of $1,600,000 -the biggest order I had ever
received.
"I know I would have lost the contract if I hadn't lost my voice,
because I had the wrong idea about the whole proposition. I
discovered, quite by accident, how richly it sometimes pays to let the
other person do the talking.'
Letting the other person do the talking helps in family situations as
well as in business. Barbara Wilson's relationship with her daughter,
Laurie, was deteriorating rapidly. Laurie, who had been a quiet,
complacent child, had grown into an uncooperative, sometimes
belligerent teenager. Mrs. Wilson lectured her, threatened her and
punished her, but all to no avail.
"One day," Mrs. Wilson told one of our classes, "I just gave up.
Laurie had disobeyed me and had left the house to visit her girl
friend before she had completed her chores. When she returned I
was about to scream at her for the ten-thousandth time, but I just
didn't have the strength to do it. I just looked at her and said sadly,
'Why, Laurie, Why?'
"Laurie noted my condition and in a calm voice asked, 'Do you really
want to know?' I nodded and Laurie told me, first hesitantly, and
then it all flowed out. I had never listened to her. I was always
telling her to do this or that. When she wanted to tell me her
thoughts, feelings, ideas, I interrupted with more orders. I began to
realize that she needed me - not as a bossy mother, but as a
confidante, an outlet for all her confusion about growing up. And all I
had been doing was talking when I should have been listening. I
never heard her.
"From that time on I let her do all the talking she wanted. She tells
me what is on her mind, and our relationship has improved
immeasurably. She is again a cooperative person."
A large advertisement appeared on the financial page of a New York
newspaper calling for a person with unusual ability and experience.
Charles T. Cubellis answered the advertisement, sending his reply to
a box number. A few days later, he was invited by letter to call for an
interview. Before he called, he spent hours in Wall Street finding out
everything possible about the person who had founded the business.
During the interview, he remarked: "I should be mighty proud to be
associated with an organization with a record like yours. I
understand you started twenty-eight years ago with nothing but desk
room and one stenographer. Is that true?"
Almost every successful person likes to reminisce about his early
struggles. This man was no exception. He talked for a long time
about how he had started with $450 in cash and an original idea. He
told how he had fought against discouragement and battled against
ridicule, working Sundays and holidays, twelve to sixteen hours a
day; how he had finally won against all odds until now the most
important executives on Wall Street were coming to him for
information and guidance. He was proud of such a record. He had a
right to be, and he had a splendid time telling about it. Finally, he
questioned Mr. Cubellis briefly about his experience, then called in
one of his vice presidents and said: "I think this is the person we are
looking for."
Mr. Cubellis had taken the trouble to find out about the
accomplishments of his prospective employer. He showed an interest
in the other person and his problems. He encouraged the other
person to do most of the talking - and made a favorable impression.
Roy G. Bradley of Sacramento, California, had the opposite problem.
He listened as a good prospect for a sales position talked himself into
a job with Bradley's firm, Roy reported:
"Being a small brokerage firm, we had no fringe benefits, such as
hospitalization, medical insurance and pensions. Every representative
is an independent agent. We don't even provide leads for prospects,
as we cannot advertise for them as our larger competitors do.
"Richard Pryor had the type of experience we wanted for this
position, and he was interviewed first by my assistant, who told him
about all the negatives related to this job. He seemed slightly
discouraged when he came into my office. I mentioned the one
benefit of being associated with my firm, that of being an
independent contractor and therefore virtually being self-employed.
"As he talked about these advantages to me, he talked himself out of
each negative thought he had when he came in for the interview.
Several times it seemed as though he was half talking to himself as
he was thinking through each thought. At times I was tempted to
add to his thoughts; however, as the interview came to a close I felt
he had convinced himself, very much on his own, that he would like
to work for my firm.
"Because I had been a good listener and let Dick do most of the
talking, he was able to weigh both sides fairly in his mind, and he
came to the positive conclusion, which was a challenge he created
for himself. We hired him and he has been an outstanding
representative for our firm,"
Even our friends would much rather talk to us about their
achievements than listen to us boast about ours. La Rochefoucauld,
the French philosopher, said: "If you want enemies, excel your
friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you."
Why is that true? Because when our friends excel us, they feel
important; but when we excel them, they - or at least some of them
- will feel inferior and envious.
By far the best-liked placement counselor in the Mid-town Personnel
Agency in New York City was Henrietta G ---- It hadn't always been
that way. During the first few months of her association with the
agency, Henrietta didn't have a single friend among her colleagues.
Why? Because every day she would brag about the placements she
had made, the new accounts she had opened, and anything else she
had accomplished.
"I was good at my work and proud of it," Henrietta told one of our
classes. " But instead of my colleagues sharing my triumphs, they
seemed to resent them. I wanted to be liked by these people. I really
wanted them to be my friends. After listening to some of the
suggestions made in this course, I started to talk about myself less
and listen more to my associates. They also had things to boast
about and were more excited about telling me about their
accomplishments than about listening to my boasting. Now, when we
have some time to chat, I ask them to share their joys with me, and
I only mention my achievements when they ask."
? Principle 6 Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.
~~~~~~~
7 - How To Get Cooperation
Don't you have much more faith in ideas that you discover for
yourself than in ideas that are handed to you on a silver platter? If
so, isn't it bad judgment to try to ram your opinions down the
throats of other people? Isn't it wiser to make suggestions - and let
the other person think out the conclusion?
Adolph Seltz of Philadelphia, sales manager in an automobile
showroom and a student in one of my courses, suddenly found
himself confronted with the necessity of injecting enthusiasm into a
discouraged and disorganized group of automobile salespeople.
Calling a sales meeting, he urged his people to tell him exactly what
they expected from him. As they talked, he wrote their ideas on the
blackboard. He then said: "I'll give you all these qualities you expect
from me. Now I want you to tell me what I have a right to expect
from you." The replies came quick and fast: loyalty, honesty,
initiative, optimism, teamwork, eight hours a day of enthusiastic
work, The meeting ended with a new courage, a new inspiration -
one salesperson volunteered to work fourteen hours a day - and Mr.
Seltz reported to me that the increase of sales was phenomenal.
"The people had made a sort of moral bargain with me, " said Mr.
Seltz, "and as long as I lived up to my part in it, they were
determined to live up to theirs. Consulting them about their wishes
and desires was just the shot in the arm they needed."
No one likes to feel that he or she is being sold some-thing or told to
do a thing. We much prefer to feel that we are buying of our own
accord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our
wishes, our wants, our thoughts.
Take the case of Eugene Wesson. He lost countless thousands of
dollars in commissions before he learned this truth. Mr. Wesson sold
sketches for a studio that created designs for stylists and textile
manufacturers. Mr. Wesson had called on one of the leading stylists
in New York once a week, every week for three years. "He never
refused to see me," said Mr. Wesson, "but he never bought. He
always looked over my sketches very carefully and then said: 'No,
Wesson, I guess we don't get together today.' "
After 150 failures, Wesson realized he must be in a mental rut, so he
resolved to devote one evening a week to the study of influencing
human behavior, to help him develop new ideas and generate new
enthusiasm.
He decided on this new approach. With half a dozen unfinished
artists' sketches under his arm, he rushed over to the buyer's office.
"I want you to do me a little favor, if you will," he said. "'Here are
some uncompleted sketches. Won't you please tell me how we could
finish them up in such a way that you could use them?"
The buyer looked at the sketches for a while without uttering a word.
Finally he said: "Leave these with me for a few days, Wesson, and
then come back and see me."
Wesson returned three davs later, got his suggestions, took the
sketches back to the studio and had them finished according to the
buyer's ideas. The result? All accepted.
After that, this buyer ordered scores of other sketches from Wesson,
all drawn according to the buyer's ideas. "I realized why I had failed
for years to sell him," said Mr. Wesson. " I had urged him to buy
what I thought he ought to have. Then I changed my approach
completely. I urged him to give me his ideas. This made him feel
that he was creating the designs. And he was. I didn't have to sell
him. He bought."
Letting the other person feel that the idea is his or hers not only
works in business and politics, it works in family life as well. Paul M.
Davis of Tulsa, Oklahoma, told his class how he applied this
principle:
"My family and I enjoyed one of the most interesting sightseeing
vacation trips we have ever taken. I had long dreamed of visiting
such historic sites as the Civil War battlefield in Gettysburg,
Independence Hall in Philadelphia, and our nation's capital. Valley
Forge, James-town and the restored colonial village of Williamsburg
were high on the list of things I wanted to see.
"In March my wife, Nancy, mentioned that she had ideas for our
summer vacation which included a tour of the western states, visiting
points of interest in New Mexico, Arizona, California and Nevada. She
had wanted to make this trip for several years. But we couldn't
obviously make both trips.
"Our daughter, Anne, had just completed a course in U.S. history in
junior high school and had become very interested in the events that
had shaped our country's growth. I asked her how she would like to
visit the places she had learned about on our next vacation. She said
she would love to.
"Two evenings later as we sat around the dinner table, Nancy
announced that if we all agreed, the summer's vacation would be to
the eastern states, that it would he a great trip for Anne and thrilling
for all of us. We all concurred."
This same psychology was used by an X-ray manufacturer to sell his
equipment to one of the largest hospitals in Brooklyn This hospital
was building an addition and preparing to equip it with the finest Xray
department in America. Dr. L----, who was in charge of the X-ray
department, was overwhelmed with sales representatives, each
caroling the praises of his own company's equipment.
One manufacturer, however, was more skillful. He knew far more
about handling human nature than the others did. He wrote a letter
something like this:
Our factory has recently completed a new line of X-ray equipment.
The first shipment of these machines has just arrived at our office.
They are not perfect. We know that, and we want to improve them.
So we should be deeply obligated to you if you could find time to
look them over and give us your ideas about how they can be made
more serviceable to your profession. Knowing how occupied you are,
I shall be glad to send my car for you at any hour you specify.
"I was surprised to get that letter," Dr. L ---- said as he related the
incident before the class. "I was both surprised and complimented. I
had never had an X-ray manufacturer seeking my advice before. It
made me feel important. I was busy every night that week, but I
canceled a dinner appointment in order to look over the equipment.
The more I studied it, the more I discovered for myself how much I
liked it.
"Nobody had tried to sell it to me. I felt that the idea of buying that
equipment for the hospital was my own. I sold myself on its superior
qualities and ordered it installed."
Ralph Waldo Emerson in his essay "Self-Reliance" stated: "In every
work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come
back to us with a certain alienated majesty."
Colonel Edward M. House wielded an enormous influence in national
and international affairs while Woodrow Wilson occupied the White
House. Wilson leaned upon Colonel House for secret counsel and
advice more than he did upon even members of his own cabinet.
What method did the Colonel use in influencing the President?
Fortunately, we know, for House himself revealed it to Arthur D.
Howden Smith, and Smith quoted House in an article in The
Saturday Evening Post.
" 'After I got to know the President,' House said, 'I learned the best
way to convert him to an idea was to plant it in his mind casually,
but so as to interest him in it - so as to get him thinking about it on
his own account. The first time this worked it was an accident. I had
been visiting him at the White House and urged a policy on him
which he appeared to disapprove. But several days later, at the
dinner table, I was amazed to hear him trot out my suggestion as his
own.' "
Did House interrupt him and say, "That's not your idea. That's mine"
? Oh, no. Not House. He was too adroit for that. He didn't care about
credit. He wanted results. So he let Wilson continue to feel that the
idea was his. House did even more than that. He gave Wilson public
credit for these ideas.
Let's remember that everyone we come in contact with is just as
human as Woodrow Wilson. So let's use Colonel House's technique.
A man up in the beautiful Canadian province of New Brunswick used
this technique on me and won my patronage. I was planning at the
time to do some fishing and canoeing in New Brunswick. So I wrote
the tourist bureau for information. Evidently my name and address
were put on a mailing list, for I was immediately overwhelmed with
scores of letters and booklets and printed testimonials from camps
and guides. I was bewildered. I didn't know which to choose. Then
one camp owner did a clever thing. He sent me the names and
telephone numbers of several New York people who had stayed at
his camp and he invited me to telephone them and discover for
myself what he had to offer.
I found to my surprise that I knew one of the men on his list. I
telephoned him, found out what his experience had been, and then
wired the camp the date of my arrival.
The others had been trying to sell me on their service, but one let
me sell myself. That organization won. Twenty-five centuries ago,
Lao-tse, a Chinese sage, said some things that readers of this book
might use today:
" The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred
mountain streams is that they keep below them. Thus they are able
to reign over all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be
above men, putteth himself below them; wishing to be before them,
he putteth himself behind them. Thus, though his place be above
men, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before them,
they do not count it an injury."
? Principle 7 - Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.

8 - A Formula That Will Work Wonders For You
Remember that other people may be totally wrong. But they don't
think so. Don't condemn them. Any fool can do that. Try to
understand them. Only wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try to
do that.
There is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does.
Ferret out that reason - and you have the key to his actions, perhaps
to his personality. Try honestly to put yourself in his place.
If you say to yourself, "How would I feel, how would I react if I were
in his shoes?" you will save yourself time and irritation, for "by
becoming interested in the cause, we are less likely to dislike the
effect." And, in addition, you will sharply increase your skill in human
relationships.
"Stop a minute," says Kenneth M. Goode in his book How to Turn
People Into Gold, "stop a minute to contrast your keen interest in
your own affairs with your mild concern about anything else. Realize
then, that everybody else in the world feels exactly the same way!
Then, along with Lincoln and Roosevelt, you will have grasped the
only solid foundation for interpersonal relationships; namely, that
success in dealing with people depends on a sympathetic grasp of
the other persons' viewpoint."
Sam Douglas of Hempstead, New York, used to tell his wife that she
spent too much time working on their lawn, pulling weeds, fertilizing,
cutting the grass twice a week when the lawn didn't look any better
than it had when they moved into their home four years earlier.
Naturally, she was distressed by his remarks, and each time he made
such remarks the balance of the evening was ruined.
After taking our course, Mr. Douglas realized how foolish he had
been all those years. It never occurred to him that she enjoyed doing
that work and she might really appreciate a compliment on her
diligence.
One evening after dinner, his wife said she wanted to pull some
weeds and invited him to keep her company. He first declined, but
then thought better of it and went out after her and began to help
her pull weeds. She was visibly pleased, and together they spent an
hour in hard work and pleasant conversation.
After that he often helped her with the gardening and complimented
her on how fine the lawn looked, what a fantastic job she was doing
with a yard where the soil was like concrete. Result: a happier life for
both because he had learned to look at things from her point of view
- even if the subject was only weeds.
In his book Getting Through to People, Dr. Gerald S. Nirenberg
commented: "Cooperativeeness in conversation is achieved when
you show that you consider the other person's ideas and feelings as
important as your own. Starting your conversation by giving the
other person the purpose or direction of your conversation,
governing what you say by what you would want to hear if you were
the listener, and accepting his or her viewpoint will encourage the
listener to have an open mind to your ideas." (*)

I have always enjoyed walking and riding in a park near my home.
Like the Druids of ancient Gaul, I all but worship an oak tree, so I
was distressed season after season to see the young trees and
shrubs killed off by needless fires. These fires weren't caused by
careless smokers. They were almost all caused by youngsters who
went out to the park to go native and cook a frankfurter or an egg
under the trees. Sometimes, these fires raged so fiercely that the fire
department had to be called out to fight the conflagration.
There was a sign on the edge of the park saying that anyone who
started a fire was liable to fine and imprisonment, but the sign stood
in an unfrequented part of the park, and few of the culprits ever saw
it. A mounted policeman was supposed to look after the park; but he
didn't take his duties too seriously, and the fires continued to spread
season after season. On one occasion, I rushed up to a policeman
and told him about a fire spreading rapidly through the park and
wanted him to notify the fire department, and he nonchalantly
replied that it was none of his business because it wasn't in his
precinct! I was desperate, so after that when I went riding, I acted
as a self-appointed committee of one to protect the public domain.
In the beginning, I am afraid I didn't even attempt to see the other
people's point of view. When I saw a fire blazing under the trees, I
was so unhappy about it, so eager to do the right thing, that I did
the wrong thing. I would ride up to the boys, warn them that they
could be jailed for starting a fire, order with a tone of authority that
it be put out; and, if they refused, I would threaten to have them
arrested. I was merely unloading my feelings without thinking of
their point of view.
The result? They obeyed - obeyed sullenly and with resentment.
After I rode on over the hill, they probably rebuilt the fire and longed
to burn up the whole park.
With the passing of the years, I acquired a trifle more knowledge of
human relations, a little more tact, a somewhat greater tendency to
see things from the other person's standpoint. Then, instead of
giving orders, I would ride up to a blazing fire and begin something
like this:
"Having a good time, boys? What are you going to cook for supper?
... I loved to build fires myself when I was a boy - and I still love to.
But you know they are very dangerous here in the park. I know you
boys don't mean to do any harm, but other boys aren't so careful.
They come along and see that you have built a fire; so they build
one and don't put it out when they go home and it spreads among
the dry leaves and kills the trees. We won't have any trees here at all
if we aren't more careful, You could be put in jail for building this
fire. But I don't want to be bossy and interfere with your pleasure. I
like to see you enjoy yourselves; but won't you please rake all the
leaves away from the fire right now - and you'll be careful to cover it
with dirt, a lot of dirt, before you leave, won't you? And the next
time you want to have some fun, won't you please build your fire
over the hill there in the sandpit? It can't do any harm there.. . .
Thanks so much, boys. Have a good time."
What a difference that kind of talk made! It made the boys want to
cooperate. No sullenness, no resentment. They hadn't been forced to
obey orders. They had saved their faces. They felt better and I felt
better because I had handled the situation with consideration for
their point of view.
Seeing things through another person's eyes may ease tensions
when personal problems become overwhelming. Elizabeth Novak of
New South Wales, Australia, was six weeks late with her car
payment. "On a Friday," she reported, "I received a nasty phone call
from the man who was handling my account informing me if I did
not come up with $122 by Monday morning I could anticipate further
action from the company. I had no way of raising the money over
the weekend, so when I received his phone call first thing on Monday
morning I expected the worst. Instead of becoming upset I looked at
the situation from his point of view. I apologized most sincerely for
causing him so much inconvenience and remarked that I must be his
most troublesome customer as this was not the first time I was
behind in my payments. His tone of voice changed immediately, and
he reassured me that I was far from being one of his really
troublesome customers. He went on to tell me several examples of
how rude his customers sometimes were, how they lied to him and
often tried to avoid talking to him at all. I said nothing. I listened and
let him pour out his troubles to me. Then, without any suggestion
from me, he said it did not matter if I couldn't pay all the money
immediately. It would be all right if I paid him $20 by the end of the
month and made up the balance whenever it was convenient for me
to do so."
Tomorrow, before asking anyone to put out a fire or buy your
product or contribute to your favorite charity, why not pause and
close your eyes and try to think the whole thing through from
another person's point of view? Ask yourself: "Why should he or she
want to do it?" True, this will take time, but it will avoid making
enemies and will get better results - and with less friction and less
shoe leather.
"I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person's office for two
hours before an interview," said Dean Donham of the Harvard
business school, "than step into that office without a perfectly clear
idea of what I was going to say and what that person - from my
knowledge of his or her interests and motives - was likely to
answer."
That is so important that I am going to repeat it in italics for the sake
of emphasis.
I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person's office for two
hours before an interview than step into that office without a
perfectly clear idea of what I was going to say and what that persob
- from my knowledge of his or her interests and motives - was likely
to answer.
If, as a result of reading this book, you get only one thing - an
increased tendency to think always in terms of the other person's
point of view, and see things from that person's angle as well as
your own - if you get only that one thing from this book, it may
easily prove to be one of the stepping - stones of your career.
? Principle 8 - Try honestly to see things from the other person's
point of view.

9 - What Everybody Wants
Wouldn't you like to have a magic phrase that would stop
arguments, eliminate ill feeling, create good will, and make the other
person listen attentively?
Yes? All right. Here it is: "I don't blame you one iota for feeling as
you do. If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do."
An answer like that will soften the most cantankerous old cuss alive.
And you can say that and be 100 percent sincere, because if you
were the other person you, of course, would feel just as he does.
Take Al Capone, for example. Suppose you had inherited the same
body and temperament and mind that Al Capone had. Suppose you
had had his environment and experiences. You would then be
precisely what he was - and where he was. For it is those things -
and only those things - that made him what he was. The only
reason, for example, that you are not a rattlesnake is that your
mother and father weren't rattlesnakes.
You deserve very little credit for being what you are - and
remember, the people who come to you irritated, bigoted,
unreasoning, deserve very little discredit for being what they are.
Feel sorry for the poor devils. Pity them. Sympathize with them. Say
to yourself: "There, but for the grace of God, go I."
Three-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and
thirsting for sympathy. Give it to them, and they will love you.
I once gave a broadcast about the author of Little Women, Louisa
May Alcott. Naturally, I knew she had lived and written her immortal
books in Concord, Massachusetts. But, without thinking what I was
saying, I spoke of visiting her old home in Concord. New Hampshire.
If I had said New Hampshire only once, it might have been forgiven.
But, alas and alack! I said it twice, I was deluged with letters and
telegrams, stinging messages that swirled around my defenseless
head like a swarm of hornets. Many were indignant. A few insulting.
One Colonial Dame, who had been reared in Concord,
Massachusetts, and who was then living in Philadelphia, vented her
scorching wrath upon me. She couldn't have been much more bitter
if I had accused Miss Alcott of being a cannibal from New Guinea. As
I read the letter, I said to myself, "Thank God, I am not married to
that woman." I felt like writing and telling her that although I had
made a mistake in geography, she had made a far greater mistake in
common courtesy. That was to be just my opening sentence. Then I
was going to roll up my sleeves and tell her what I really thought.
But I didn't. I controlled myself. I realized that any hotheaded fool
could do that - and that most fools would do just that.
I wanted to be above fools. So I resolved to try to turn her hostility
into friendliness. It would be a challenge, a sort of game I could
play. I said to myself, "After all, if I were she, I would probably feel
just as she does." So, I determined to sympathize with her
viewpoint. The next time I was in Philadelphia, I called her on the
telephone. The conversation went something like this:
ME: Mrs. So-and-So, you wrote me a letter a few weeks ago, and I
want to thank you for it.
SHE: (in incisive, cultured, well-bred tones): To whom have I the
honor of speaking?
ME: I am a stranger to you. My name is Dale Carnegie. You listened
to a broadcast I gave about Louisa May Alcott a few Sundays ago,
and I made the unforgivable blunder of saying that she had lived in
Concord, New Hampshire. It was a stupid blunder, and I want to
apologize for it. It was so nice of you to take the time to write me.
SHE : I am sorry, Mr. Carnegie, that I wrote as I did. I lost my
temper. I must apologize.
ME: No! No! You are not the one to apologize; I am. Any school child
would have known better than to have said what I said. I apologized
over the air the following Sunday, and I want to apologize to you
personally now.
SHE : I was born in Concord, Massachusetts. My family has been
prominent in Massachusetts affairs for two centuries, and I am very
proud of my native state. I was really quite distressed to hear you
say that Miss Alcott had lived in New Hampshire. But I am really
ashamed of that letter.
ME: I assure you that you were not one-tenth as distressed as I am.
My error didn't hurt Massachusetts, but it did hurt me. It is so
seldom that people of your standing and culture take the time to
write people who speak on the radio, and I do hope you will write
me again if you detect an error in my talks.
SHE: You know, I really like very much the way you have accepted
my criticism. You must be a very nice person. I should like to know
you better.
So, because I had apologized and sympathized with her point of
view, she began apologizing and sympathizing with my point of view,
I had the satisfaction of controlling my temper, the satisfaction of
returning kindness for an insult. I got infinitely more real fun out of
making her like me than I could ever have gotten out of telling her to
go and take a jump in the Schuylkill River,
Every man who occupies the White House is faced almost daily with
thorny problems in human relations. President Taft was no
exception, and he learned from experience the enormous chemical
value of sympathy in neutralizing the acid of hard feelings. In his
book Ethics in Service, Taft gives rather an amusing illustration of
how he softened the ire of a disappointed and ambitious mother.
"A lady in Washington," wrote Taft, "whose husband had some
political influence, came and labored with me for six weeks or more
to appoint her son to a position. She secured the aid of Senators and
Congressmen in formidable number and came with them to see that
they spoke with emphasis. The place was one requiring technical
qualification, and following the recommendation of the head of the
Bureau, I appointed somebody else. I then received a letter from the
mother, saying that I was most ungrateful, since I declined to make
her a happy woman as I could have done by a turn of my hand. She
complained further that she had labored with her state delegation
and got all the votes for an administration bill in which I was
especially interested and this was the way I had rewarded her.
"When you get a letter like that, the first thing you do is to think how
you can be severe with a person who has committed an impropriety,
or even been a little impertinent. Then you may compose an answer.
Then if you are wise, you will put the letter in a drawer and lock the
drawer. Take it out in the course of two days - such communications
will always bear two days' delay in answering - and when you take it
out after that interval, you will not send it. That is just the course I
took. After that, I sat down and wrote her just as polite a letter as I
could, telling her I realized a mother's disappointment under such
circumstances, but that really the appointment was not left to my
mere personal preference, that I had to select a man with technical
qualifications, and had, therefore, to follow the recommendations of
the head of the Bureau. I expressed the hope that her son would go
on to accomplish what she had hoped for him in the position which
he then had. That mollified her and she wrote me a note saying she
was sorry she had written as she had.
"But the appointment I sent in was not confirmed at once, and after
an interval I received a letter which purported to come from her
husband, though it was in the the same handwriting as all the
others. I was therein advised that, due to the nervous prostration
that had followed her disappointment in this case, she had to take to
her bed and had developed a most serious case of cancer of the
stomach. Would I not restore her to health by withdrawing the first
name and replacing it by her son's? I had to write another letter, this
one to the husband, to say that I hoped the diagnosis would prove
to be inaccurate, that I sympathized with him in the sorrow he must
have in the serious illness of his wife, but that it was impossible to
withdraw the name sent in. The man whom I appointed was
confirmed, and within two days after I received that letter, we gave
a musicale at the White House. The first two people to greet Mrs.
Taft and me were this husband and wife, though the wife had so
recently been in articulo mortis."
Jay Mangum represented an elevator-escalator main-tenance
company in Tulsa, Oklahoma, which had the maintenance contract
for the escalators in one of Tulsa's leading hotels. The hotel manager
did not want to shut down the escalator for more than two hours at
a time because he did not want to inconvenience the hotel's guests.
The repair that had to be made would take at least eight hours, and
his company did not always have a specially qualified mechanic
available at the convenience of the hotel.
When Mr. Mangum was able to schedule a top-flight mechanic for
this job, he telephoned the hotel manager and instead of arguing
with him to give him the necessary time, he said:
"Rick, I know your hotel is quite busy and you would like to keep the
escalator shutdown time to a minimum. I understand your concern
about this, and we want to do everything possible to accommodate
you. However, our diagnosis of the situation shows that if we do not
do a complete job now, your escalator may suffer more serious
damage and that would cause a much longer shutdown. I know you
would not want to inconvenience your guests for several days."
The manager had to agree that an eight-hour shut down was more
desirable than several days'. By sympathizing with the manager's
desire to keep his patrons happy, Mr. Mangum was able to win the
hotel manager to his way of thinking easily and without rancor.
Joyce Norris, a piano teacher in St, Louis, Missouri, told of how she
had handled a problem piano teachers often have with teenage girls.
Babette had exceptionally long fingernails. This is a serious handicap
to anyone who wants to develop proper piano-playing habits.
Mrs. Norris reported: "I knew her long fingernails would be a barrier
for her in her desire to play well. During our discussions prior to her
starting her lessons with me, I did not mention anything to her about
her nails. I didn't want to discourage her from taking lessons, and I
also knew she would not want to lose that which she took so much
pride in and such great care to make attractive.
"After her first lesson, when I felt the time was right, I said:
'Babette, you have attractive hands and beautiful fingernails. If you
want to play the piano as well as you are capable of and as well as
you would like to, you would be surprised how much quicker and
easier it would be for you, if you would trim your nails shorter. Just
think about it, Okay?' She made a face which was definitely negative.
I also talked to her mother about this situation, again mentioning
how lovely her nails were. Another negative reaction. It was obvious
that Babette's beautifully manicured nails were important to her.
"The following week Babette returned for her second lesson. Much to
my surprise, the fingernails had been trimmed. I complimented her
and praised her for making such a sacrifice. I also thanked her
mother for influencing Babette to cut her nails. Her reply was 'Oh, I
had nothing to do with it. Babette decided to do it on her own, and
this is the first time she has ever trimmed her nails for anyone.' "
Did Mrs. Norris threaten Babette? Did she say she would refuse to
teach a student with long fingernails? No, she did not. She let
Babette know that her finger-nails were a thing of beauty and it
would be a sacrifice to cut them. She implied, "I sympathize with you
- I know it won't be easy, but it will pay off in your better musical
development."
Sol Hurok was probably America's number one impresario. For
almost half a century he handled artists - such world-famous artists
as Chaliapin, Isadora Duncan, and Pavlova. Mr. Hurok told me that
one of the first lessons he had learned in dealing with his
temperamental stars was the' necessity for sympathy, sympathy and
more sympathy with their idiosyncrasies.
For three years, he was impresario for Feodor Chaliapin -one of the
greatest bassos who ever thrilled the ritzy boxholders at the
Metropolitan, Yet Chaliapin was a constant problem. He carried on
like a spoiled child. To put it in Mr. Hurok's own inimitable phrase:
"He was a hell of a fellow in every way."
For example, Chaliapin would call up Mr. Hurok about noun of the
day he was going to sing and say, "Sol, I feel terrible. My throat is
like raw hamburger. It is impossible for me to sing tonight." Did Mr.
Hurok argue with him? Oh, no. He knew that an entrepreneur
couldn't handle artists that way. So he would rush over to Chaliapin's
hotel, dripping with sympathy. "What a pity, " he would mourn.
"What a pity! My poor fellow. Of course, you cannot sing. I will
cancel the engagement at once. It will only cost you a couple of
thousand dollars, but that is nothing in comparison to your
reputation."
Then Chaliapin would sigh and say, "Perhaps you had better come
over later in the day. Come at five and see how I feel then."
At five o'clock, Mr. Hurok would again rush to his hotel, dripping with
sympathy. Again he would insist on canceling the engagement and
again Chaliapin would sigh and say, "Well, maybe you had better
come to see me later. I may be better then."
At seven-thirty the great basso would consent to sing, only with the
understanding that Mr. Hurok would walk out on the stage of the
Metropolitan and announce that Chaliapin had a very bad cold and
was not in good voice. Mr. Hurok would lie and say he would do it,
for he knew that was the only way to get the basso out on the stage.
Dr. Arthur I. Gates said in his splendid book Educational Psychology:
"Sympathy the human species universally craves. The child eagerly
displays his injury; or even inflicts a cut or bruise in order to reap
abundant sympathy. For the same purpose adults ... show their
bruises, relate their accidents, illness, especially details of surgical
operations. 'Self-pity' for misfortunes real or imaginary is in some
measure, practically a universal practice."
So, if you want to win people to your way of thinking, put in practice
...
? Principle 9 - Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and
desires.

10 - An Appeal That Everybody Likes
I was reared on the edge of the Jesse James country out in Missouri,
and I visited the James farm at Kearney, Missouri, where the son of
Jesse James was then living.
His wife told me stories of how Jesse robbed trains and held up
banks and then gave money to the neighboring farmers to pay off
their mortgages.
Jesse James probably regarded himself as an idealist at heart, just as
Dutch Schultz, "Two Gun" Crowley, Al Capone and many other
organized crime "godfathers" did generations later. The fact is that
all people you meet have a high regard for themselves and like to be
fine and unselfish in their own estimation.
J. Pierpont Morgan observed, in one of his analytical interludes, that
a person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds
good and a real one.
The person himself will think of the real reason. You don't need to
emphasize that. But all of us, being idealists at heart, like to think of
motives that sound good. So, in order to change people, appeal to
the nobler motives.
Is that too idealistic to work in business? Let's see. Let's take the
case of Hamilton J. Farrell of the Farrell-Mitchell Company of
Glenolden, Pennsylvania. Mr. Farrell had a disgruntled tenant who
threatened to move. The tenant's lease still had four months to run;
nevertheless, he served notice that he was vacating immediately,
regardless of lease.
"These people had lived in my house all winter - the most expensive
part of the year," Mr. Farrell said as he told the story to the class,
"and I knew it would be difficult to rent the apartment again before
fall. I could see all that rent income going over the hill and believe
me, I saw red.
"Now, ordinarily, I would have waded into that tenant and advised
him to read his lease again. I would have pointed out that if he
moved, the full balance of his rent would fall due at once - and that I
could, and would, move to collect.
"However, instead of flying off the handle and making a scene, I
decided to try other tactics. So I started like this: 'Mr. Doe,' I said, 'I
have listened to your story, and I still don't believe you intend to
move. Years in the renting business have taught me something
about human nature, and I sized you up in the first place as being a
man of your word. In fact, I'm so sure of it that I'm willing to take a
gamble.
" 'Now, here's my proposition. Lav your decision on the table for a
few days and think it over. If you come back to me between now
and the first of the month, when your rent is due, and tell me you
still intend to move, I give you my word I will accept your decision as
final. I will privilege you to move and admit to myself I've been
wrong in my judgment. But I still believe you're a man of your word
and will live up to your contract. For after all, we are either men or
monkeys - and the choice usually lies with ourselves!'
"Well, when the new month came around, this gentleman came to
see me and paid his rent in person. He and his wife had talked it
over, he said - and decided to stay. They had concluded that the
only honorable thing to do was to live up to their lease."
When the late Lord Northcliffe found a newspaper using a picture of
him which he didn't want published, he wrote the editor a letter. But
did he say, "Please do not publish that picture of me any more; I
don't like it"? No, he appealed to a nobler motive. He appealed to the
respect and love that all of us have for motherhood. He wrote,
"Please do not publish that picture of me any more. My mother
doesn't like it."
When John D. Rockefeller, Jr., wished to stop newspaper
photographers from snapping pictures of his children, he too
appealed to the nobler motives. He didn't, say: "I don't want their
pictures published." No, he appealed to the desire, deep in all of us,
to refrain from harming children. He said: "You know how it is, boys.
You've got children yourselves, some of you. And you know it's not
good for youngsters to get too much publicity."
When Cyrus H. K. Curtis, the poor boy from Maine, was starting on
his meteoric career, which was destined to make him millions as
owner of The Saturday Evening Post and the Ladies' Home Journal,
he couldn't afford to pay his contributors the prices that other
magazines paid. He couldn't afford to hire first-class authors to write
for money alone. So he appealed to their nobler motives. For
example, he persuaded even Louisa May Alcott, the immortal author
of Little Women, to write for him when she was at the flood tide of
her fame; and he did it by offering to send a check for a hundred
dollars, not to her, but to her favorite charity.
Right here the skeptic may say: "Oh, that stuff is all right for
Northcliffe and Rockefeller or a sentimental novelist. But, I'd like to
see you make it work with the tough babies I have to collect bills
from!"
You may be right. Nothing will work in all cases - and nothing will
work with all people. If you are satisfied with the results you are now
getting, why change? If you are not satisfied, why not experiment?
At any rate, I think you will enjoy reading this true story told by
James L. Thomas, a former student of mine:
Six customers of a certain automobile company refused to pay their
bills for servicing. None of the customers protested the entire bill,
but each claimed that some one charge was wrong. In each case,
the customer had signed for the work done, so the company knew it
was right - and said so. That was the first mistake.
Here are the steps the men in the credit department took to collect
these overdue bills. Do you suppose they succeeded?
? 1. They called on each customer and told him bluntly that they had
come to collect a bill that was long past due.
? 2. They made it very plain that the company was absolutely and
unconditionally right; therefore he, the customer, was absolutely and
unconditionally wrong.
? 3. They intimated that they, the company, knew more about
automobiles than he could ever hope to know. So what was the
argument about?
? 4. Result: They argued.
Did any of these methods reconcile the customer and settle the
account? You can answer that one yourself.
At this stage of affairs, the credit manager was about to open fire
with a battery of legal talent, when fortunately the matter came to
the attention of the general manager. The manager investigated
these defaulting clients and discovered that they all had the
reputation of paying their bills promptly, Something was wrong here
- something was drastically wrong about the method of collection. So
he called in James L. Thomas and told him to collect these
"uncollectible" accounts.
Here, in his words, are the steps Mr. Thrrmas took:
1. My visit to each customer was likewise to collect a bill long past
due - a bill that we knew was absolutely right. But I didn't say a
word about that. I explained I had called to find out what it was the
company had done, or failed to do.
2. I made it clear that, until I had heard the customer's story, I had
no opinion to offer. I told him the company made no claims to being
infallible.
3. I told him I was interested only in his car, and that he knew more
about his car than anyone else in the world; that he was the
authority on the subject.
4. I let him talk, and I listened to him with all the interest and
sympathy that he wanted - and had expected.
5. Finally, when the customer was in a reasonable mood, I put the
whole thing up to his sense of fair play. I appealed to the nobler
motives. "First," I said, "I want you to know I also feel this matter
has been badly mishandled. You've been inconvenienced and
annoyed and irritated by one of our representatives. That should
never have happened. I'm sorry and, as a representative of the
company, I apologize. As I sat here and listened to your side of the
story, I could not help being impressed by your fairness and
patience. And now, because you are fair - minded and patient, I am
going to ask you to do something for me. It's something that you
can do better than anyone else, something you know more about
than anyone else. Here is your bill; I know it is safe for me to ask
you to adjust it, just as you would do if you were the president of my
company. I am going to leave it all up to you. Whatever you say
goes."
Did he adjust the bill? He certainly did, and got quite a kick out of it,
The bills ranged from $150 to $400 - but did the customer give
himself the best of it? Yes, one of them did! One of them refused to
pay a penny of the disputed charge; but the other five all gave the
company the best of it! And here's the cream of the whole thing: we
delivered new cars to all six of these customers within the next two
years!
"Experience has taught me," says Mr. Thomas, "that when no
information can be secured about the customer, the only sound basis
on which to proceed is to assume that he or she is sincere, honest,
truthful and willing and anxious to pay the charges, once convinced
they are correct. To put it differently and perhaps mare clearly,
people are honest and want to discharge their obligations. The
exceptions to that rule are comparatively few, and I am convinced
that the individuals who are inclined to chisel will in most cases react
favorably if you make them feel that you consider them honest,
upright and fair."
? Principle 10 - Appeal to the nobler motives.

11 - The Movies Do It. Tv Does It. Why Don't You Do It?
Many years ago, the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin was being
maligned by a dangerous whispering campaign. A malicious rumor
was being circulated. Advertisers were being told that the newspaper
was no longer attractive to readers because it carried too much
advertising and too little news. Immediate action was necessary. The
gossip had to be squelched.
But how?
This is the way it was done.
The Bulletin clipped from its regular edition all reading matter of all
kinds on one average day, classified it, and published it as a book.
The book was called One Day. It contained 307 pages - as many as a
hard-covered book; yet the Bulletin had printed all this news and
feature material on one day and sold it, not for several dollars, but
for a few cents.
The printing of that book dramatized the fact that the Bulletin carried
an enormous amount of interesting reading matter. It conveyed the
facts more vividly, more interestingly, more impressively, than pages
of figures and mere talk could have done.
This is the day of dramatization. Merely stating a truth isn't enough.
The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic. You have to
use showmanship. The movies do it. Television does it. And you will
have to do it if you want attention.
Experts in window display know the power of dramazation. For
example, the manufacturers of a new rat poison gave dealers a
window display that included two live rats. The week the rats were
shown, sales zoomed to five times their normal rate.
Television commercials abound with examples of the use of dramatic
techniques in selling products. Sit down one evening in front of your
television set and analyze what the advertisers do in each of their
presentations. You will note how an antacid medicine changes the
color of the acid in a test tube while its competitor doesn't, how one
brand of soap or detergent gets a greasy shirt clean when the other
brand leaves it gray. You'll see a car maneuver around a series of
turns and curves - far better than just being told about it. Happy
faces will show contentment with a variety of products. All of these
dramatize for the viewer the advantages offered by whatever is
being sold - and they do get people to buy them.
You can dramatize your ideas in business or in any other aspect of
your life. It's easy. Jim Yeamans, who sells for the NCR company
(National Cash Register) in Richmond, Virginia, told how he made a
sale by dramatic demonstration.
"Last week I called on a neighborhood grocer and saw that the cash
registers he was using at his checkout counters were very oldfashioned.
I approached the owner and told him: 'You are literally
throwing away pennies every time a customer goes through your
line.' With that I threw a handful of pennies on the floor. He quickly
became more attentive. The mere words should have been of
interest to him, but the sound of Pennies hitting the floor really
stopped him. I was able to get an order from him to replace all of his
old machines."
It works in home life as well. When the old-time lover Proposed to
his sweetheart, did he just use words of love? No! He went down on
his knees. That really showed he meant what he said. We don't
propose on our knees any more, but many suitors still set up a
romantic atmosphere before they pop the question.
Dramatizing what you want works with children as well. Joe B. Fant,
Jr., of Birmingham, Alabama, was having difficulty getting his fiveyear-
old boy and three-year-old daughter to pick up their toys, so he
invented a "train." Joey was the engineer (Captain Casey Jones) on
his tricycle. Janet's wagon was attached, and in the evening she
loaded all the "coal" on the caboose (her wagon) and then jumped in
while her brother drove her around the room. In this way the room
was cleaned up - without lectures, arguments or threats.
Mary Catherine Wolf of Mishawaka, Indiana, was having some
problems at work and decided that she had to discuss them with the
boss. On Monday morning she requested an appointment with him
but was told he was very busy and she should arrange with his
secretary for an appointment later in the week. The secretary
indicated that his schedule was very tight, but she would try to fit
her in.
Ms. Wolf described what happened:
"I did not get a reply from her all week long. Whenever I questioned
her, she would give me a reason why the boss could not see me.
Friday morning came and I had heard nothing definite. I really
wanted to see him and discuss my problems before the weekend, so
I asked myself how I could get him to see me.
"What I finally did was this. I wrote him a formal letter. I indicated in
the letter that I fully understood how extremely busy he was all
week, but it was important that I speak with him. I enclosed a form
letter and a self-addressed envelope and asked him to please fill it
out or ask his secretary to do it and return it to me. The form letter
read as follows:
Ms. Wolf - I will be able to see you on __________ a t
__________A.M/P.M. I will give you _____minutes of my time.
"I put this letter in his in-basket at 11 A.M. At 2 P.M. I checked my
mailbox. There was my self-addressed envelope. He had answered
my form letter himself and indicated he could see me that afternoon
and could give me ten minutes of his time. I met with him, and we
talked for over an hour and resolved my problems.
"If I had not dramatized to him the fact that I really wanted to see
him, I would probably be still waiting for an appointment."
James B. Boynton had to present a lengthy market report. His firm
had just finished an exhaustive study for a leading brand of cold
cream. Data were needed immediately about the competition in this
market; the prospective customer was one of the biggest - and most
formidable - men in the advertising business.
And his first approach failed almost before he began.
"The first time I went in," Mr. Boynton explains, "I found myself
sidetracked into a futile discussion of the methods used in the
investigation. He argued and I argued. He told me I was wrong, and
I tried to prove that I was right.
"I finally won my point, to my own satisfaction - but my time was up,
the interview was over, and I still hadn't produced results.
"The second time, I didn't bother with tabulations of figures and
data, I went to see this man, I dramatized my facts I.
"As I entered his office, he was busy on the phone. While he finished
his conversation, I opened a suitcase and dumped thirty-two jars of
cold cream on top of his desk - all products he knew - all competitors
of his cream.
"On each jar, I had a tag itemizing the results of the trade
investigation, And each tag told its story briefly, dramatically.
"What happened?
"There was no longer an argument. Here was something new,
something different. He picked up first one and then another of the
jars of cold cream and read the information on the tag. A friendly
conversation developed. He asked additional questions. He was
intensely interested. He had originally given me only ten minutes to
present my facts, but ten minutes passed, twenty minutes, forty
minutes, and at the end of an hour we were still talking.
"I was presenting the same facts this time that I had presented
previously. But this time I was using dramatization, showmanship -
and what a difference it made."
? Principle 11 - Dramatize your ideas.

12 - When Nothing Else Works, Try This
Charles Schwab had a mill manager whose people weren't producing
their quota of work.
"How is it," Schwab asked him, "that a manager as capable as you
can't make this mill turn out what it should?"
"I don't know," the manager replied. "I've coaxed the men, I've
pushed them, I've sworn and cussed, I've threatened them with
damnation and being fired. But nothing works. They just won't
produce."
This conversation took place at the end of the day, just before the
night shift came on. Schwab asked the manager for a piece of chalk,
then, turning to the nearest man, asked: "How many heats did your
shift make today?"
"Six."
Without another word, Schwab chalked a big figure six on the floor,
and walked away.
When the night shift came in, they saw the "6" and asked what it
meant.
"The big boss was in here today," the day people said. "He asked us
how many heats we made, and we told him six. He chalked it down
on the floor."
The next morning Schwab walked through the mill again. The night
shift had rubbed out "6" and replaced it with a big "7."
When the day shift reported for work the next morning, they saw a
big "7" chalked on the floor. So the night shift thought they were
better than the day shift did they? Well, they would show the night
shift a thing or two. The crew pitched in with enthusiasm, and when
they quit that night, they left behind them an enormous, swaggering
"10." Things were stepping up.
Shortly this mill, which had been lagging way behind in production,
was turning out more work than any other mill in the plant.
The principle?
Let Charles Schwab say it in his own words: "The way to get things
done," say Schwab, "is to stimulate competition. I do not mean in a
sordid, money-getting way, but in the desire to excel."
The desire to excel! The challenge! Throwing down the gauntlet! An
infallible way of appealing to people of spirit.
Without a challenge, Theodore Roosevelt would never have been
President of the United States. The Rough Rider, just back from
Cuba, was picked for governor of New York State. The opposition
discovered he was no longer a legal resident of the state, and
Roosevelt, frightened, wished to withdraw. Then Thomas Collier
Platt, then U.S. Senator from New York, threw down the challenge.
Turning suddenly on Theodore Roosevelt, he cried in a ringing voice:
"Is the hero of San Juan Hill a coward?"
Roosevelt stayed in the fight - and the rest is history. A challenge not
only changed his life; it had a real effect upon the future of his
nation.
"All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go
forward, sometimes to death, but always to victory" was the motto
of the King's Guard in ancient Greece. What greater challenge can be
offered than the opportunity to overcome those fears?
When Al Smith was governor of New York, he was up against it. Sing
Sing, at the time the most notorious pen-itentiary west of Devil's
Island, was without a warden. Scandals had been sweeping through
the pristin walls, scandals and ugly rumors. Smith needed a strong
man to rule Sing Sing - an iron man. But who? He sent for Lewis E.
Lawes of New Hampton.
"How about going up to take charge of Sing Sing?" he said jovially
when Lawes stood before him. "They need a man up there with
experience."
Lawes was flabbergasted. He knew the dangers of Sing Sing. It was
a political appointment, subject to the vagaries of political whims.
Wardens had come and gone - one had lasted only three weeks. He
had a career to consider. Was it worth the risk?
Then Smith, who saw his hesitation, leaned back in his chair and
smiled. "Young fellow," he said, "I don't blame you for being scared.
It's a tough spot. It'll take a big person to go up there and stay."
So Smith was throwing down a challenge, was he? Lawes liked the
idea of attempting a job that called for someone "big."
So he went. And he stayed. He stayed, to become the most famous
warden of his time. His book 20,000 Years in Sing Sing sold into the
hundred of thousands of copies. His broadcasts on the air and his
stories of prison life have inspired dozens of movies. His
"humanizing" of criminals wrought miracles in the way of prison
reform.
"I have never found," said Harvey S. Firestone, founder of the great
Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, "that pay and pay alone would
either bring together or hold good people. I think it was the game
itself."
Frederic Herzberg, one of the great behavorial scientists, concurred.
He studied in depth the work attitudes of thousands of people
ranging from factory workers to senior executives. What do you think
he found to be the most motivating factor - the one facet of the jobs
that was most stimulating? Money? Good working conditions? Fringe
benefits? No - not any of those. The one major factor that motivated
people was the work itself. If the work was exciting and interesting,
the worker looked forward to doing it and was motivated to do a
good job.
That is what every successful person loves: the game. The chance
for self-expression. The chance to prove his or her worth, to excel, to
win. That is what makes foot-races and hog-calling and pie-eating
contests. The desire to excel. The desire for a feeling of importance.
? Principle 12 - Throw down a challenge.
In A Nutshell - Win People To Your Way Of Thinking

it.

Part Four - Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving
Offense or Arousing Resentment
1 - If You Must Find Fault, This Is The Way To Begin
A friend of mine was a guest at the White House for a weekend
during the administration of Calvin Coolidge. Drifting into the
President's private office, he heard Coolidge say to one of his
secretaries, "That's a pretty dress you are wearing this morning, and
you are a very attractive young woman."
That was probably the most effusive praise Silent Cal had ever
bestowed upon a secretary in his life. It was so unusual, so
unexpected, that the secretary blushed in confusion. Then Coolidge
said, "Now, don't get stuck up. I just said that to make you feel
good. From now on, I wish you would be a little bit more careful with
your Punctuation."
His method was probably a bit obvious, but the psychology was
superb. It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we
have heard some praise of our good points.
A barber lathers a man before he shaves him; and that is precisely
what McKinley did back in 1896, when he was running for President.
One of the prominent Republicans of that day had written a
campaign speech that he felt was just a trifle better than Cicero and
Patrick Henry and Daniel Webster all rolled into one. With great glee,
this chap read his immortal speech aloud to McKinley. The speech
had its fine points, but it just wouldn't do. It would have raised a
tornado of criticism. McKinley didn't want to hurt the man's feelings.
He must not kill the man's splendid enthusiasm, and yet he had to
say "no." Note how adroitly he did it.
"My friend, that is a splendid speech, a magnificent speech,"
McKinley said. "No one could have prepared a better one. There are
many occasions on which it would be precisely the right thing to say,
but is it quite suitable to this particular occasion? Sound and sober as
it is from your standpoint, I must consider its effect from the party's
standpoint. Now you go home and write a speech along the lines I
indicate, and send me a copy of it."
He did just that. McKinley blue-penciled and helped him rewrite his
second speech, and he became one of the effective speakers of the
campaign.
Here is the second most famous letter that Abraham Lincoln ever
wrote. (His most famous one was written to Mrs. Bixby, expressing
his sorrow for the death of the five sons she had lost in battle.)
Lincoln probably dashed this letter off in five minutes; yet it sold at
public auction in 1926 for twelve thousand dollars, and that, by the
way, was more money than Lincoln was able to save during half a
century of hard work. The letter was written to General Joseph
Hooker on April 26, 1863, during the darkest period of the Civil War.
For eighteen months, Lincoln's generals had been leading the Union
Army from one tragic defeat to another. Nothing but futile, stupid
human butchery. The nation was appalled. Thousands of soldiers
had deserted from the army, and en the Republican members of the
Senate had revolted and wanted to force Lincoln out of the White
House. "We are now on the brink of destruction," Lincoln said. It
appears to me that even the Almighty is against us. I can hardly see
a ray of hope." Such was the black sorrow and chaos out of which
this letter came.
I am printing the letter here because it shows how Lincoln tried to
change an obstreperous general when the very fate of the nation
could have depended upon the general's action.
This is perhaps the sharpest letter Abe Lincoln wrote after he
became President; yet you will note that he praised General Hooker
before he spoke of his grave faults.
Yes, they were grave faults, but Lincoln didn't call them that. Lincoln
was more conservative, more diplomatic. Lincoln wrote: "There are
some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you."
Talk about tact! And diplomacy!
Here is the letter addressed to General Hooker:
I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac. Of
course, I have done this upon what appears to me to be sufficient
reasons, and yet I think it best for you to know that there are some
things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you.
I believe you to be a brave and skillful soldier, which, of course, I
like. I also believe you do not mix politics with your profession, in
which you are right. You have confidence in yourself, which is a
valuable if not an indispensable quality.
You are ambitious, which, within reasonable bounds, does good
rather than harm, But I think that during General Burnside's
command of the army you have taken counsel of your ambition and
thwarted him as much as you could, in which you did a great wrong
to the country and to a most meritorious and honorable brother
officer.
I have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently saying
that both the army and the Government needed a dictator. Of
course, it was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have given you
command.
Only those generals who gain successes can set up as dictators.
What I now ask of you is military success and I will risk the
dictatorship.
The Government will support you to the utmost of its ability, which is
neither more nor less than it has done and will do for all
commanders. I much fear that the spirit which you have aided to
infuse into the army, of criticizing their commander and withholding
confidence from him, will now turn upon you. I shall assist you, as
far as I can, to put it down.
Neither you nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any good
out of an army while such spirit prevails in it, and now beware of
rashness. Beware of rashness, but with energy and sleepless
vigilance go forward and give us victories.
You are not a Coolidge, a McKinley or a Lincoln. You want to know
whether this philosophy will operate for you in everyday business
contacts. Will it? Let's see. Let's take the case of W. P. Gaw of the
Wark Company, Philadelphia.
The Wark Company had contracted to build and complete a large
office building in Philadelphia by a certain specified date. Everything
was going along well; the building was almost finished, when
suddenly the sub-contractor making the ornamental bronze work to
go on the exterior of this building declared that he couldn't make
delivery on schedule. What! An entire building held up! Heavy
penalties! Distressing losses! All because of one man!
Long-distance telephone calls. Arguments! Heated conversations! All
in vain. Then Mr. Gaw was sent to New York to beard the bronze lion
in his den.
"Do you know you are the only person in Brooklyn with your name,?"
Mr Gaw asked the president of the subcontracting firm shortly after
they were introduced. The president was surprised. "No, I didn't
know that."
"Well," said Mr. Gaw, "when I got off the train this morning, I looked
in the telephone book to get your address, and you're the only
person in the Brooklyn phone book with your name."
"I never knew that," the subcontractor said. He checked the phone
book with interest. "Well, it's an unusual name," he said proudly. "My
family came from Holland and settled in New York almost two
hundred years ago. " He continued to talk about his family and his
ancestors for several minutes. When he finished that, Mr. Gaw
complimented him on how large a plant he had and compared it
favorably with a number of similar plants he had visited. "It is one of
the cleanest and neatest bronze factories I ever saw," said Gaw.
"I've spent a lifetime building up this business," the subcontractor
said, "and I am rather proud of it. Would you like to take a look
around the factory?"
During this tour of inspection, Mr. Gaw complimented the other man
on his system of fabrication and told him how and why it seemed
superior to those of some of his competitors. Gaw commented on
some unusual machines, and the subcontractor announced that he
himself had invented those machines. He spent considerable time
showing Gaw how they operated and the superior work they turned
out. He insisted on taking his visitor to lunch. So far, mind you, not a
word had been said about the real purpose of Gaw's visit.
After lunch, the subcontractor said, "Now, to get down to business.
Naturally, I know why you're here. I didn't expect that our meeting
would be so enjoyable. You can go back to Philadelphia with my
promise that your material will be fabricated and shipped, even if
other orders have to be delayed."
Mr. Gaw got everything that he wanted without even asking for it.
The material arrived on time, and the building was completed on the
day the completion contract specified.
Would this have happened had Mr. Gaw used the hammer-anddynamite
method generally employed on such occasions?
Dorothy Wrublewski, a branch manager of the Fort Monmouth, New
Jersey, Federal Credit Union, reported to one of our classes how she
was able to help one of her employees become more productive.
"We recently hired a young lady as a teller trainee. Her contact with
our customers was very good. She was accurate and efficient in
handling individual transactions. The problem developed at the end
of the day when it was time to balance out.
"The head teller came to me and strongly suggested that I fire this
woman. 'She is holding up everyone else because she is so slow in
balancing out. I've shown her over and over, but she can't get it.
She's got to go.'
"The next day I observed her working quickly and accurately when
handling the normal everyday transactions, and she was very
pleasant with our customers.
"It didn't take long to discover why she had trouble balancing out.
After the office closed, I went over to talk with her. She was
obviously nervous and upset. I praised her for being so friendly and
outgoing with the customers and complimented her for the accuracy
and speed used in that work. I then suggested we review the
procedure we use in balancing the cash drawer. Once she realized I
had confidence in her, she easily followed my suggestions and soon
mastered this function. We have had no problems with her since
then."
Beginning with praise is like the dentist who begins his work with
Novocain. The patient still gets a drilling, but the Novocain is painkilling.
A leader will use ...
? Principle 1 - Begin with praise and honest appreciation.
~~~~~~~
2 - How To Criticize-And Not Be Hated For It
Charles Schwab was passing through one of his steel mills one day at
noon when he came across some of his employees smoking.
Immediately above their heads was a sign that said "No Smoking."
Did Schwab point to the sign and say, "Can't you read.? Oh, no not
Schwab. He walked over to the men, handed each one a cigar, and
said, "I'll appreciate it, boys, if you will smoke these on the outside."
They knew that he knew that they had broken a rule - and they
admired him because he said nothing about it and gave them a little
present and made them feel important. Couldn't keep from loving a
man like that, could you?
John Wanamaker used the same technique. Wanamaker used to
make a tour of his great store in Philadelphia every day. Once he
saw a customer waiting at a counter. No one was paying the
slightest attention to her. The salespeople? Oh, they were in a
huddle at the far end of the counter laughing and talking among
themselves. Wanamaker didn't say a word. Quietly slipping behind
the counter, he waited on the woman himself and then handed the
purchase to the salespeople to be wrapped as he went on his way.
Public officials are often criticized for not being accessible to their
constituents. They are busy people, and the fault sometimes lies in
overprotective assistants who don't want to overburden their bosses
with too many visitors. Carl Langford, who has been mayor of
Orlando,
Florida, the home of Disney World, for many years, frequently
admonished his staff to allow people to see him. clamed he had an
"open-door" policy; yet the citizens of his community were blocked
by secretaries and administrators when they called.
Finally the mayor found the solution. He removed the door from his
office! His aides got the message, and the mayor has had a truly
open administration since the day his door was symbolically thrown
away.
Simply changing one three-letter word can often spell the difference
between failure and success in changing people without giving
offense or arousing resentment.
Many people begin their criticism with sincere praise followed by the
word "but" and ending with a critical statement. For example, in
trying to change a child's careless attitude toward studies, we might
say, "We're really proud of you, Johnnie, for raising your grades this
term. But if you had worked harder on your algebra, the results
would have been better."
In this case, Johnnie might feel encouraged until he heard the word
"but." He might then question the sincerity of the original praise. To
him, the praise seemed only to be a contrived lead-in to a critical
inference of failure. Credibility would be strained, and we probably
would not achieve our objectives of changing Johnnie's attitude
toward his studies.
This could be easily overcome by changing the word "but" to "and."
"We're really proud of you, Johnnie, for raiseing your grades this
term, and by continuing the same conscientious efforts next term,
your algebra grade can be up with all the others."
Now, Johnnie would accept the praise because there was no followup
of an inference of failure. We have called his attention to the
behavior we wished to change indirectly and the chances are he will
try to live up to our expectations.
Calling attention to one's mistakes indirectly works wonders with
sensitive people who may resent bitterly any direct criticism. Marge
Jacob of Woonsocket, Rhode Island, told one of our classes how she
convinced some sloppy construction workers to clean up after
themselves when they were building additions to her house.
For the first few days of the work, when Mrs. Jacob returned from
her job, she noticed that the yard was strewn with the cut ends of
lumber. She didn't want to antagonize the builders, because they did
excellent work. So after the workers had gone home, she and her
children picked up and neatly piled all the lumber debris in a corner.
The following morning she called the foreman to one side and said,
"I'm really pleased with the way the front lawn was left last night; it
is nice and clean and does not offend the neighbors." From that day
forward the workers picked up and piled the debris to one side, and
the foreman came in each day seeking approval of the condition the
lawn was left in after a day's work.
One of the major areas of controversy between members of the
army reserves and their regular army trainers is haircuts. The
reservists consider themselves civilians (which they are most of the
time) and resent having to cut their hair short.
Master Sergeant Harley Kaiser of the 542nd USAR School addressed
himself to this problem when he was working with a group of reserve
noncommissioned officers. As an old-time regular-army master
sergeant, he might have been expected to yell at his troops and
threaten them. Instead he chose to make his point indirectly.
"Gentlemen," he started, "you are leaders. You will be most effective
when you lead by example. You must be the example for your men
to follow. You know what the army regulations say about haircuts. I
am going to get my hair cut today, although it is still much shorter
than some of yours. You look at yourself in the mirror, and if you feel
you need a haircut to be a good example, we'll arrange time for you
to visit the post barbership."
The result was predictable. Several of the candidates did look in the
mirror and went to the barbershop that afternoon and received
"regulation" haircuts. Sergeant Kaiser commented the next morning
that he already could see the development of leadership qualities in
some of the members of the squad.
On March 8, 1887, the eloquent Henry Ward Beecher died. The
following Sunday, Lyman Abbott was invited to speak in the pulpit
left silent by Beecher's passing. Eager to do his best, he wrote,
rewrote and polished his sermon with the meticulous care of a
Flaubert. Then he read it to his wife. It was poor - as most written
speeches are. She might have said, if she had had less judgment,
"Lyman, that is terrible. That'll never do. You'll put people to sleep. It
reads like an encyclopedia. You ought to know better than that after
all the years you have been preaching. For heaven's sake, why don't
you talk like a human being? Why don't you act natural? You'll
disgrace yourself if you ever read that stuff."
That's what she might have said. And, if she had, you know what
would have happened. And she knew too. So, she merely remarked
that it would make an excellent article for the North American
Review. In other words, she praised it and at the same time subtly
suggested that it wouldn't do as a speech. Lyman Abbott saw the
point, tore up his carefully prepared manuscript and preached
without even using notes.
An effective way to correct others' mistakes is ...
? Principle 2 - Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly.
~~~~~~~
3 - Talk About Your Own Mistakes First
My niece, Josephine Carnegie, had come to New York to be my
secretary. She was nineteen, had graduated from high school three
years previously, and her business experience was a trifle more than
zero. She became one of the most proficient secretaries west of
Suez, but in the beginning, she was - well, susceptible to
improvement. One day when I started to criticize her, I said to
myself: "Just a minute, Dale Carnegie; just a minute. You are twice
as old as Josephine. You have had ten thousand times as much
business experience. How can you possibly expect her to have your
viewpoint, your judgment, your initiative - mediocre though they
may be? And just a minute, Dale, what were you doing at nineteen?
Remember the asinine mistakes and blunders you made? Remember
the time you did this ... and that ... ?"
After thinking the matter over, honestly and impartially, I concluded
that Josephine's batting average at nineteen was better than mine
had been - and that, I'm sorry to confess, isn't paying Josephine
much of a compliment.
So after that, when I wanted to call Josephine's attention to a
mistake, I used to begin by saying, "You have made a mistake,
Josephine, but the Lord knows, it's no worse than many I have
made. You were not born with judgment. That comes only with
experience, and you are better than I was at your age. I have been
guilty of so many stupid, silly things myself, I have very little incliion
to criticize you or anyone. But don't you think it would have been
wiser if you had done so and so?"
It isn't nearly so difficult to listen to a recital of your faults if the
person criticizing begins by humbly admitting that he, too, is far from
impeccable.
E.G. Dillistone, an engineer in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada, was
having problems with his new secretary. Letters he dictated were
coming to his desk for signature with two or three spelling mistakes
per page. Mr. Dillistone reported how he handled this:
"Like many engineers, I have not been noted for my excellent
English or spelling. For years I have kept a little black thumb - index
book for words I had trouble spelling. When it became apparent that
merely pointing out the errors was not going to cause my secretary
to do more proofreading and dictionary work, I resolved to take
another approach. When the next letter came to my attention that
had errors in it, I sat down with the typist and said:
" 'Somehow this word doesn't look right. It's one of the words I
always have had trouble with. That's the reason I started this
spelling book of mine. [I opened the book to the appropriate page.]
Yes, here it is. I'm very conscious of my spelling now because people
do judge us by our letters and misspellings make us look less
professional.
"I don't know whether she copied my system or not, but since that
conversation, her frequency of spelling errors has been significantly
reduced."
The polished Prince Bernhard von B§îlow learned the sharp necessity
of doing this back in 1909. Von B§îlow was then the Imperial
Chancellor of Germany, and on the throne sat Wilhelm II-Wilhelm,
the haughty; Wilhelm the arrogant; Wilhelm, the last of the German
Kaisers, building an army and navy that he boasted could whip their
weight in wildcats
Then an astonishing thing happened. The Kaiser said things,
incredible things, things that rocked the continent and started a
series of explosions heard around the world. To make matters
infinitely worse, the Kaiser made silly, egotistical, absurd
announcements in public, he made them while he was a guest in
England, and he gave his royal permission to have them printed in
the Daily Telegraph. For example, he declared that he was the only
German who felt friendly toward the English; that he was
constructing a navy against the menace of Japan; that he, and he
alone, had saved England from being humbled in the dust by Russia
and France; that it had been his campaign plan that enabled
England's Lord Roberts to defeat the Boers in South Africa; and so
on and on.
No other such amazing words had ever fallen from the lips of a
European king in peacetime within a hundred years. The entire
continent buzzed with the fury of a hornet's nest. England was
incensed. German statesmen were aghast. And in the midst of all
this consternation, the Kaiser became panicky and suggested to
Prince von B§îlow, the Imperial Chancellor, that he take the blame.
Yes, he wanted von B§îlow to announce that it was all his
responsibility, that he had advised his monarch to say these
incredible things.
"But Your Majesty," von B§îlow protested, "it seems to me utterly
impossible that anybody either in Germany or England could suppose
me capable of having advised Your Majesty to say any such thing."
The moment those words were out of von B§îlow's mouth, he
realized he had made a grave mistake. The Kaiser blew up.
"You consider me a donkey," he shouted, "capable of blunders you
yourself could never have committed!"
Von B§îlow's knew that he ought to have praised before he
condemned; but since that was too late, he did the next best thing.
He praised after he had criticized. And it worked a miracle.
"I'm far from suggesting that," he answered respectfully. "Your
Majesty surpasses me in manv respects; not only of course, in naval
and military knowledge but above all, in natural science. I have often
listened in admiration when Your Majesty explained the barometer,
or wireless telegraphy, or the Roentgen rays. I am shamefully
ignorant of all branches of natural science, have no notion of
chemistry or physics, and am quite incapable of explaining the
simplest of natural phenomena. But," von B§îllow continued, "in
compensation, I possess some historical knowledge and perhaps
certain qualities useful in politics, especially in diplomacy."
The Kaiser beamed. Von Bulow had praised him. Von B§îlow had
exalted him and humbled himself. The Kaiser could forgive anything
after that. "Haven't I always told you," he exclaimed with
enthusiasm, "that we complete one another famously? We should
stick together, and we will!"
He shook hands with von B§îlow, not once, but several times. And
later in the day he waxed so enthusiastic that he exclaimed with
doubled fists, "If anyone says anything to me against Prince von
B§îlow, I shall punch him in the nose."
Von B§îlow saved himself in time - but, canny diplomat that he was,
he nevertheless had made one error: he should have begun by
talking about his own shortcomings and Wilhelm's superiority - not
by intimating that the Kaiser was a half-wit in need of a guardian.
If a few sentences humbling oneself and praising the other party can
turn a haughty, insulted Kaiser into a staunch friend, imagine what
humility and praise can do for you and me in our daily contacts.
Rightfully used, they will work veritable miracles in human relations.
Admitting one's own mistakes - even when one hasn't corrected
them - can help convince somebody to change his behavior. This
was illustrated more recently by Clarence Zerhusen of Timonium,
Maryland, when he discovered his fifteen-year-old son was
experimenting with cigarettes.
"Naturally, I didn't want David to smoke," Mr. Zerhusen told us, "but
his mother and I smoked cigarettes; we were giving him a bad
example all the time. I explained to Dave how I started smoking at
about his age and how the nicotine had gotten the best of me and
now it was nearly impossible for me to stop. I reminded him how
irritating my cough was and how he had been after me to give up
cigarettes not many years before.
"I didn't exhort him to stop or make threats or warn him about their
dangers. All I did was point out how I was hooked on cigarettes and
what it had meant to me.
"He thought about it for a while and decided he wouldn't smoke until
he had graduated from high school. As the years went by David
never did start smoking and has no intention of ever doing so.
"As a result of that conversation I made the decision to stop smoking
cigarettes myself, and with the support of my family, I have
succeeded."
A good leader follows this principle:
? Principle 3 - Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the
other person.

4 - No One Likes To Take Orders
I once had the pleasure of dining with Miss Ida Tarbell, the dean of
American biographers. When I told her I was writing this book, we
began discussing this all-important subject of getting along with
people, and she told me that while she was writing her biography of
Owen D. Young, she interviewed a man who had sat for three years
in the same office with Mr. Young. This man declared that during all
that time he had never heard Owen D. Young give a direct order to
anyone. He always gave suggestions, not orders. Owen D. Young
never said, for example, "Do this or do that," or "Don't do this or
don't do that." He would say, "You might consider this," or "Do you
think that would work?" Frequently he would say, after he had
dictated a letter, "What do you think of this?" In looking over a letter
of one of his assistants, he would say, "Maybe if we were to phrase it
this way it would be better." He always gave people the opportunity
to do things themselves; he never told his assistants to do things; he
let them do them, let them learn from their mistakes.
A technique like that makes it easy for a person to correct errors. A
technique like that saves a person's pride and gives him or her a
feeling of importance. It encourages cooperation instead of rebellion.
Resentment caused by a brash order may last a long time -even if
the order was given to correct an obviously bad situation. Dan
Santarelli, a teacher at a vocational school in Wyoming,
Pennsylvania, told one of our classes how one of his students had
blocked the entrance way to one of the school's shops by illegally
parking his car in it. One of the other instructors stormed into the
classroom and asked in an arrogant tone, "Whose car is blocking the
driveway?" When the student who owned the car responded, the
instructor screamed: "Move that car and move it right now, or I'll
wrap a chain around it and drag it out of there."
Now that student was wrong. The car should not have been parked
there. But from that day on, not only did that student resent the
instructor's action, but all the students in the class did everything
they could to give the instructor a hard time and make his job
unpleasant.
How could he have handled it differently? If he had asked in a
friendly way, "Whose car is in the driveway?" and then suggested
that if it were moved, other cars could get in and out, the student
would have gladly moved it and neither he nor his classmates would
have been upset and resentful.
Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable; it often
stimulates the creativity of the persons whom you ask. People are
more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision
that caused the order to be issued.
When Ian Macdonald of Johannesburg, South Africa, the general
manager of a small manufacturing plant specializing in precision
machine parts, had the opportunity to accept a very large order, he
was convinced that he would not meet the promised delivery date.
The work already scheduled in the shop and the short completion
time needed for this order made it seem impossible for him to accept
the order.
Instead of pushing his people to accelerate their work and rush the
order through, he called everybody together, explained the situation
to them, and told them how much it would mean to the company
and to them if they could make it possible to produce the order on
time. Then he started asking questions:
"Is there anything we can do to handle this order?"
"Can anyone think of different ways to process it through the shop
that will make it possible to take the order?"
"Is there any way to adjust our hours or personnel assignments that
would help?"
The employees came up with many ideas and insisted that he take
the order. They approached it with a "We can do it" attitude, and the
order was accepted, produced and delivered on time.
An effective leader will use ...
? Principle 4 - Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.

5 - Let The Other Person Save Face
Years ago the General Electric Company was faced with the delicate
task of removing Charles Steinmetz from the head of a department.
Steinmetz, a genius of the first magnitude when it came to
electricity, was a failure as the head of the calculating department.
Yet the company didn't dare offend the man. He was indispensable -
and highly sensitive. So they gave him a new title. They made him
Consulting Engineer of the General Electric Company - a new title for
work he was already doing -and let someone else head up the
department.
Steinmetz was happy.
So were the officers of G.E. They had gently maneuvered their most
temperamental star, and they had done it without a storm - by
letting him save face.
Letting one save face! How important, how vitally important that is!
And how few of us ever stop to think of it! We ride roughshod over
the feelings of others, getting our own way, finding fault, issuing
threats, criticizing a child or an employee in front of others, without
even considering the hurt to the other person's pride. Whereas a few
minutes' thought, a considerate word or two, a genuine
understanding of the other person's attitude, would go so far toward
alleviating the sting!
Let's remember that the next time we are faced with the distasteful
necessity of discharging or reprimanding an employee.
"Firing employees is not much fun. Getting fired is even less fun."
(I'm quoting now from a letter written me by Marshall A. Granger, a
certified public accountant.) "Our business is mostly seasonal.
Therefore we have to let a lot of people go after the income tax rush
is over.
It's a byword in our profession that no one enjoys wielding the ax.
Consequently, the custom has developed of getting it over as soon
as possible, and usually in the following way: 'Sit down, Mr. Smith.
The season's over, and we don't seem to see any more assignments
for you. Of course, you understood you were only employed for the
busy season anyhow, etc., etc.'
"The effect on these people is one of disappointment and a feeling of
being 'let down.' Most of them are in the accounting field for life, and
they retain no particular love for the firm that drops them so
casually.
"I recently decided to let our seasonal personnel go with a little more
tact and consideration. So I call each one in only after carefully
thinking over his or her work during the winter. And I've said
something like this: 'Mr. Smith, you've done a fine job (if he has).
That time we sent you to Newark, you had a tough assignment. You
were on the spot, but you came through with flying colors, and we
want you to know the firm is proud of you. You've got the stuff -
you're going a long way, wherever you're working. This firm believes
in you, and is rooting for you, and we don't want you to forget it.'
"Effect? The people go away feeling a lot better about being fired.
They don't feel 'let down.' They know if we had work for them, we'd
keep them on. And when we need them again, they come to us with
a keen personal affection."
At one session of our course, two class members discussed the
negative effects of faultfinding versus the positive effects of letting
the other person save face.
Fred Clark of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, told of an incident that
occurred in his company: "At one of our production meetings, a vice
president was asking very pointed questions of one of our production
supervisors regarding a production process. His tone of voice was
aggressive and aimed at pointing out faulty performance on the part
of the supervisor. Not wanting to be embarrassed in front of his
peers, the supervisor was evasive in his responses. This caused the
vice president to lose his temper, berate the supervisor and accuse
him of lying.
"Any working relationship that might have existed prior to this
encounter was destroyed in a few brief moments. This supervisor,
who was basically a good worker, was useless to our company from
that time on. A few months later he left our firm and went to work
for a competitor, where I understand he is doing a fine job."
Another class member, Anna Mazzone, related how a similar incident
had occurred at her job - but what a difference in approach and
results! Ms. Mazzone, a marketing specialist for a food packer, was
given her first major assignment - the test-marketing of a new
product. She told the class: "When the results of the test came in, I
was devastated. I had made a serious error in my planning, and the
entire test had to be done all over again. To make this worse, I had
no time to discuss it with my boss before the meeting in which I was
to make my report on the project.
"When I was called on to give the report, I was shaking with fright. I
had all I could do to keep from breaking down, but I resolved I
would not cry and have all those men make remarks about women
not being able to handle a management job because they are too
emotional. I made my report briefly and stated that due to an error I
would repeat the study before the next meeting. I sat down,
expecting my boss to blow up.
"Instead, he thanked me for my work and remarked that it was not
unusual for a person to make an error on a new project and that he
had confidence that the repeat survey would be accurate and
meaningful to the company. He Assured me, in front of all my
colleagues, that he had faith in me and I knew I had done my best,
and that my lack of experience, not my lack of ability, was the
reason for the failure.
I left that meeting with my head in the air and with the
determination that I would never let that boss of mine down again."
Even if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we only
destroy ego by causing someone to lose face. The legendary French
aviation pioneer and author Antoine de Saint-Exup§Ûry wrote: "I have
no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes.
What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of
himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime."
A real leader will always follow ...
? Principle 5 - Let the other person save face.

6 - How To Spur People On To Success
Pete Barlow was an old friend of mine. He had a dog-and-pony act
and spent his life traveling with circuses and vaudeville shows. I
loved to watch Pete train new dogs for his act. I noticed that the
moment a dog showed the slightest improvement, Pete patted and
praised him and gave him meat and made a great to-do about it.
That's nothing new. Animal trainers have been using that same
technique for centuries.
Why, I wonder, don't we use the same common sense when trying
to change people that we use when trying to change dogs? Why
don't we use meat instead of a whip? Why don't we use praise
instead of condemnation? Let us praise even the slightest
improvement. That inspires the other person to keep on improving.
In his book I Ain't Much, Baby-But I'm All I Got, the psychologist Jess
Lair comments: "Praise is like sunlight to the warm human spirit; we
cannot flower and grow without it. And yet, while most of us are only
too ready to apply to others the cold wind of criticism, we are
somehow reluctant to give our fellow the warm sunshine of praise."
(*)

[*] Jess Lair, I Ain't Much, Baby - But I'm All I Got (Greenwich,
Conn.: Fawcett, 1976), p.248.
----
I can look back at my own life and see where a few words of praise
have sharply changed my entire future. Can't you say the same thing
about your life? History is replete with striking illustrations of the
sheer witchery raise.
For example, many years ago a boy of ten was working in a factory
in Naples, He longed to be a singer, but his first teacher discouraged
him. "You can't sing," he said. "You haven't any voice at all. It
sounds like the wind in the shutters."
But his mother, a poor peasant woman, put her arms about him and
praised him and told him she knew he could sing, she could already
see an improvement, and she went barefoot in order to save money
to pay for his music lessons. That peasant mother's praise and
encouragement changed that boy's life. His name was Enrico Caruso,
and he became the greatest and most famous opera singer of his
age.
In the early nineteenth century, a young man in London aspired to
be a writer. But everything seemed to be against him. He had never
been able to attend school more than four years. His father had been
flung in jail because he couldn't pay his debts, and this young man
often knew the pangs of hunger. Finally, he got a job pasting labels
on bottles of blacking in a rat-infested warehouse, and he slept at
night in a dismal attic room with two other boys - guttersnipes from
the slums of London. He had so little confidence in his ability to write
that he sneaked out and mailed his first manuscript in the dead of
night so nobody would laugh at him. Story after story was refused.
Finally the great day came when one was accepted. True, he wasn't
paid a shilling for it, but one editor had praised him. One editor had
given him recognition. He was so thrilled that he wandered aimlessly
around the streets with tears rolling down his cheeks.
The praise, the recognition, that he received through getting one
story in print, changed his whole life, for if it hadn't been for that
encouragement, he might have spent his entire life working in ratinfested
factories. You may have heard of that boy. His name was
Charles Dickens.
Another boy in London made his living as a clerk in a dry-goods
store. He had to get up at five o'clock, sweep out the store, and
slave for fourteen hours a day. It was sheer drudgery and he
despised it. After two years, he could stand it no longer, so he got up
one morning and, without waiting for breakfast, tramped fifteen
miles to talk to his mother, who was working as a housekeeper.
He was frantic. He pleaded with her. He wept. He swore he would
kill himself if he had to remain in the shop any longer. Then he wrote
a long, pathetic letter to his old schoolmaster, declaring that he was
heartbroken, that he no longer wanted to live. His old schoolmaster
gave him a little praise and assured him that he really was very
intelligent and fitted for finer things and offered him a job as a
teacher.
That praise changed the future of that boy and made a lasting
impression on the history of English literature. For that boy went on
to write innumerable best-selling books and made over a million
dollars with his pen. You've probably heard of him. His name: H. G.
Wells.
Use of praise instead of criticism is the basic concept of B.F.
Skinner's teachings. This great contemporary psychologist has shown
by experiments with animals and with humans that when criticism is
minimized and praise emphasized, the good things people do will be
reinforced and the poorer things will atrophy for lack of attention.
John Ringelspaugh of Rocky Mount, North Carolina, used this in
dealing with his children. It seemed that, as in so many families,
mother and dad's chief form of communication with the children was
yelling at them. And, as in so many cases, the children became a
little worse rather than better after each such session - and so did
the parents. There seemed to be no end in sight for this problem.
Mr. Ringelspaugh determined to use some of the principles he was
learning in our course to solve this situation. He reported: "We
decided to try praise instead of harping on their faults. It wasn't easy
when all we could see were the negative things they were doing; it
was really tough to find things to praise. We managed to find
something, and within the first day or two some of the really
upsetting things they were doing quit happening. Then some of their
other faults began to disappear. They began capitalizing on the
praise we were giving them. They even began going out of their way
to do things right. Neither of us could believe it. Of course, it didn't
last forever, but the norm reached after things leveled off was so
much better. It was no longer necessary to react the way we used
to. The children were doing far more right things than wrong ones."
All of this was a result of praising the slightest improvement in the
children rather than condemning everything they did wrong.
This works on the job too. Keith Roper of Woodland Hills, California,
applied this principle to a situation in his company. Some material
came to him in his print shop which was of exceptionally high
quality. The printer who had done this job was a new employee who
had been having difficulty adjusting to the job. His supervisor was
upset about what he considered a negative attitude and was
seriously thinking of terminating his services.
When Mr. Roper was informed of this situation, he personally went
over to the print shop and had a talk with the young man. He told
him how pleased he was with the work he had just received and
pointed out it was the best work he had seen produced in that shop
for some time. He pointed out exactly why it was superior and how
important the young man's contribution was to the company,
Do you think this affected that young printer's attitude toward the
company? Within days there was a complete turnabout. He told
several of his co-workers about the conversation and how someone
in the company really appreciated good work. And from that day on,
he was a loyal and dedicated worker.
What Mr. Roper did was not just flatter the young printer and say
"You're good." He specifically pointed out how his work was superior.
Because he had singled out a specific accomplishment, rather than
just making general flattering remarks, his praise became much
more meaningful to the person to whom it was given. Everybody
likes to be praised, but when praise is specific, it comes across as
sincere - not something the other person may be saying just to make
one feel good.
Remember, we all crave appreciation and recognition, and will do
almost anything to get it. But nobody wants insincerity. Nobody
wants flattery.
Let me repeat: The principles taught in this book will work only when
they come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am
talking about a new way of life.
Talk about changing people. If you and I will inspire the people with
whom we come in contact to a realization of the hidden treasures
they possess, we can do far more than change people. We can
literally transform them.
Exaggeration? Then listen to these sage words from William James,
one of the most distinguished psychologists and philosophers
America has ever produced:
Compared with what we ought to be, we are only half awake. We
are making use of only a small part of our physical and mental
resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives
far within his limits. He possesses powers of various sorts which he
habitually fails to use.
Yes, you who are reading these lines possess powers of various sorts
which you habitually fail to use; and one of these powers you are
probably not using to the fullest extent is your magic ability to praise
people and inspire them with a realization of their latent possibilities.
Abilities wither under criticism; they blossom under encouragement.
To become a more effective leader of people, apply ...
? Principle 6 - Praise the slightest improvement and praise every
improvement. Be "hearty in your approbation and lavish in your
praise."

7 - Give A Dog A Good Name
What do you do when a person who has been a good worker begins
to turn in shoddy work? You can fire him or her, but that really
doesn't solve anything. You can berate the worker, but this usually
causes resentment. Henry Henke, a service manager for a large
truck dealership in Lowell, Indiana, had a mechanic whose work had
become less than satisfactory. Instead of bawling him out or
threatening him, Mr. Henke called him into his office and had a
heart-to-heart talk with him.
"Bill," he said, "you are a fine mechanic. You have been in this line of
work for a good number of years. You have repaired many vehicles
to the customers' satisfaction. In fact, we've had a number of
compliments about the good work you have done. Yet, of late, the
time you take to complete each job has been increasing and your
work has not been up to your own old standards. Because you have
been such an outstanding mechanic in the past, I felt sure you would
want to know that I am not happy with this situation, and perhaps
jointly we could find some way to correct the problem."
Bill responded that he hadn't realized he had been falling down in his
duties and assured his boss that the work he was getting was not
out of his range of expertise and he would try to improve in the
future.
Did he do it? You can be sure he did. He once again became a fast
and thorough mechanic. With that reputation Mr. Henke had given
him to live up to, how could he do anything else but turn out work
comparable to that which he had done in the past.
"The average person," said Samuel Vauclain, then president of the
Baldwin Locomotive Works, "can be led readily if you have his or her
respect and if you show that you respect that person for some kind
of ability."
In short, if you want to improve a person in a certain spect, act as
though that particular trait were already one of his or her
outstanding characteristics. Shakespeare said "Assume a virtue, if
you have it not." And it might be well to assume and state openly
that other people have the virtue you want them to develop. Give
them a fine reputation to live up to, and they will make prodigious
efforts rather than see you disillusioned.
Georgette Leblanc, in her book Souvenirs, My Life with Maeterlinck,
describes the startling transformation of a humble Belgian Cinderella.
"A servant girl from a neighboring hotel brought my meals," she
wrote. "She was called 'Marie the Dish washer' because she had
started her career as a scullery assistant. She was a kind of monster,
cross-eyed, bandylegged, poor in flesh and spirit.
"One day, while she was holding my plate of macaroni in her red
hand, I said to her point-blank, 'Marie, you do not know what
treasures are within you.'
"Accustomed to holding back her emotion, Marie waited a few
moments, not daring to risk the slightest gesture for fear of a
castastrophe. Then she put the dish on the table, sighed and said
ingenuously, 'Madame, I would never have believed it.' She did not
doubt, she did not ask a question. She simply went back to the
kitchen and repeated what I had said, and such is the force of faith
that no one made fun of her. From that day on, she was even given
a certain consideration. But the most curious change of all occurred
in the humble Marie herself. Believing she was the tabernacle of
unseen marvels, she began taking care of her face and body so
carefully that her starved youth seemed to bloom and modestly hide
her plainness.
"Two months later, she announced her coming marriage with the
nephew of the chef. 'I'm going to be a lady,' she said, and thanked
me. A small phrase had changed her entire life."
Georgette Leblanc had given "Marie the Dishwasher" a reputation to
live up to - and that reputation had transformed her.
Bill Parker, a sales representative for a food company in Daytona
Beach, Florida, was very excited about the new line of products his
company was introducing and was upset when the manager of a
large independent food market turned down the opportunity to carry
it in his store. Bill brooded all day over this rejection and decided to
return to the store before he went home that evening and try again.
"Jack," he said, "since I left this morning I realized I hadn't given you
the entire picture of our new line, and I would appreciate some of
your time to tell you about the points I omitted. I have respected the
fact that you are always willing to listen and are big enough to
change your mind when the facts warrant a change."
Could Jack refuse to give him another hearing? Not with that
reputation to live up to.
One morning Dr. Martin Fitzhugh, a dentist in Dublin, Ireland, was
shocked when one of his patients pointed out to him that the metal
cup holder which she was using to rinse her mouth was not very
clean. True, the patient drank from the paper cup, not the holder,
but it certainly was not professional to use tarnished equipment.
When the patient left, Dr. Fitzhugh retreated to his private office to
write a note to Bridgit, the charwoman, who came twice a week to
clean his office. He wrote:
My dear Bridgit,
I see you so seldom, I thought I'd take the time to thank you for the
fine job of cleaning you've been doing. By the way, I thought I'd
mention that since two hours, twice a week, is a very limited amount
of time, please feel free to work an extra half hour from time to time
if you feel you need to do those "once-in-a-while" things like
polishing the cup holders and the like. I, of course, will pay you for
the extra time.
"The next day, when I walked into my office," Dr. Fitzhugh reported,
"My desk had been polished to a mirror-like finish, as had my chair,
which I nearly slid out of. When I went into the treatment room I
found the shiniest, cleanest chrome-plated cup holder I had ever
seen nestled in its receptacle. I had given my char-woman a fine
reputation to live up to, and because of this small gesture she
outperformed all her past efforts. How much additional time did she
spend on this? That's right-none at all ."
There is an old saying: "Give a dog a bad name and you may as well
hang him." But give him a good name - and see what happens!
When Mrs. Ruth Hopkins, a fourth-grade teacher in Brooklyn, New
York, looked at her class roster the first day of school, her
excitement and joy of starting a new term was tinged with anxiety.
In her class this year she would have Tommy T., the school's most
notorious "bad boy." His third-grade teacher had constantly
complained about Tommy to colleagues, the principal and anyone
else who would listen. He was not just mischievous; he caused
serious discipline problems in the class, picked fights with the boys,
teased the girls, was fresh to the teacher, and seemed to get worse
as he grew older. His only redeeming feature was his ability to learn
rapidly and master the-school work easily.
Mrs. Hopkins decided to face the "Tommy problem" immediately.
When she greeted her new students, she made little comments to
each of them: "Rose, that's a pretty dress you are wearing," "Alicia, I
hear you draw beautifully." When she came to Tommy, she looked
him straight in the eyes and said, "Tommy, I understand you are a
natural leader. I'm going to depend on you to help me make this
class the best class in the fourth grade this year." She reinforced this
over the first few days by complimenting Tommy on everything he
did and commenting on how this showed what a good student he
was. With that reputation to live up to, even a nine-year-old couldn't
let her down - and he didn't.
If you want to excel in that difficult leadership role of changing the
attitude or behavior of others, use ...

8 - Make The Fault Seem Easy To Correct
A bachelor friend of mine, about forty years old, became engaged,
and his fianc§Ûe persuaded him to take some belated dancing lessons.
"The Lord knows I needed dancing lessons," he confessed as he told
me the story, "for I danced just as I did when I first started twenty
years ago. The first teacher I engaged probably told me the truth.
She said I was all wrong; I would just have to forget everything and
begin all over again. But that took the heart out of me. I had no
incentive to go on. So I quit her.
"The next teacher may have been lying, but I liked it. She said
nonchalantly that my dancing was a bit old-fashioned perhaps, but
the fundamentals were all right, and she assured me I wouldn't have
any trouble learning a few new steps. The first teacher had
discouraged me by emphasizing my mistakes. This new teacher did
the opposite. She kept praising the things I did right and minimizing
my errors. 'You have a natural sense of rhythm,' she assured me.
'You really are a natural-born dancer.' Now my common sense tells
me that I always have been and always will be a fourth-rate dancer;
yet, deep in my heart, I still like to think that maybe she meant it. To
be sure, I was paying her to say it; but why bring that up?
"At any rate, I know I am a better dancer than I would have been if
she hadn't told me I had a natural sense of rhythm. That encouraged
me. That gave me hope. That made me want to improve."
Tell your child, your spouse, or your employee that he or she is
stupid or dumb at a certain thing, has no gift for it, and is doing it all
wrong, and you have destroyed almost every incentive to try to
improve. But use the opposite technique - be liberal with your
encouragement, make the thing seem easy to do, let the other
person know that you have faith in his ability to do it, that he has an
undeveloped flair for it - and he will practice until the dawn comes in
the window in order to excel.
Lowell Thomas, a superb artist in human relations, used this
technique, He gave you confidence, inspired you with courage and
faith. For example, I spent a weekend with Mr. and Mrs. Thomas;
and on Saturday night, I was asked to sit in on a friendly bridge
game before a roaring fire. Bridge? Oh, no! No! No! Not me. I knew
nothing about it. The game had always been a black mystery to me,
No! No! Impossible!
"Why, Dale, it is no trick at all," Lowell replied. "There is nothing to
bridge except memory and judgment. You've written articles on
memory. Bridge will be a cinch for you. It's right up your alley."
And presto, almost before I realized what I was doing, I found
myself for the first time at a bridge table. All because I was told I
had a natural flair for it and the game was made to seem easy.
Speaking of bridge reminds me of Ely Culbertson, whose books on
bridge have been translated into a dozen languages and have sold
more than a million copies. Yet he told me he never would have
made a profession out of the game if a certain young woman hadn't
assured him he had a flair for it.
When he came to America in 1922, he tried to get a job teaching in
philosophy and sociology, but he couldn't. Then he tried selling coal,
and he failed at that
Then he tried selling coffee, and he failed at that, too.
He had played some bridge, but it had never occurred to him in
those days that someday he would teach it. He was not only a poor
card player, but he was also very stubborn. He asked so many
questions and held so many post-mortem examinations that no one
wanted to play with him.
Then he met a pretty bridge teacher, Josephine Dillon, fell in love
and married her. She noticed how carefully he analyzed his cards
and persuaded him that he was a potential genius at the card table.
It was that encouragement and that alone, Culbertson told me, that
caused him to make a profession of bridge.
Clarence M. Jones, one of the instructors of our course in Cincinnati,
Ohio, told how encouragement and making faults seem easy to
correct completely changed the life of his son.
"In 1970 my son David, who was then fifteen years old, came to live
with me in Cincinnati. He had led a rough life. In 1958 his head was
cut open in a car accident, leaving a very bad scar on his forehead.
In 1960 his mother and I were divorced and he moved to Dallas,
Texas, with his mother. Until he was fifteen he had spent most of his
school years in special classes for slow learners in the Dallas school
system. Possibly because of the scar, school administrators had
decided he was brain-injured and could not function at a normal
level. He was two years behind his age group, so he was only in the
seventh grade. Yet he did not know his multiplication tables, added
on his fingers and could barely read.
"There was one positive point. He loved to work on radio and TV
sets. He wanted to become a TV technician. I encouraged this and
pointed out that he needed math to qualify for the training. I decided
to help him become proficient in this subject. We obtained four sets
of flash cards: multiplication, division, addition and subtraction. As
we went through the cards, we put the correct answers in a discard
stack. When David missed one, I gave him the correct answer and
then put the card in the repeat stack until there were no cards left. I
made a big deal out of each card he got right, particularly if he had
missed it previously. Each night we would go through the repeat
stack until there were no cards left.
Each night we timed the exercise with a stop watch. I promised him
that when he could get all the cards correct in eight minutes with no
incorrect answers, we would quit doing it every night. This seemed
an impossible goal to David. The first night it took 52 minutes, the
second night, 48, then 45, 44, 41 then under 40 minutes. We
celebrated each reduction. I'd call in my wife, and we would both
hug him and we'd all dance a jig. At the end of the month he was
doing all the cards perfectly in less than eight minutes. When he
made a small improvement he would ask to do it again. He had
made the fantastic discovery that learning was easy and fun.
"Naturally his grades in algebra took a jump. It is amazing how much
easier algebra is when you can multiply. He astonished himself by
bringing home a B in math. That had never happened before. Other
changes came with almost unbelievable rapidity. His reading
improved rapidly, and he began to use his natural talents in drawing.
Later in the school year his science teacher assigned him to develop
an exhibit. He chose to develop a highly complex series of models to
demonstrate the effect of levers. It required skill not only in drawing
and model making but in applied mathematics. The exhibit took first
prize in his school's science fair and was entered in the city
competition and won third prize for the entire city of Cincinnati.
"That did it. Here was a kid who had flunked two grades, who had
been told he was 'brain-damaged,' who had been called
'Frankenstein' by his classmates and told his brains must have leaked
out of the cut on his head. Suddenly he discovered he could really
learn and accomplish things. The result? From the last quarter of the
eighth grade all the way through high school, he never failed to
make the honor roll; in high school he was elected to the national
honor society. Once he found learning was easy, his whole life
changed."
If you want to help others to improve, remember ...
? Principle 8 - Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to
correct.

9 - Making People Glad To Do What You Want
Back in 1915, America was aghast. For more than a year, the nations
of Europe had been slaughtering one another on a scale never
before dreamed of in all the bloody annals of mankind. Could peace
be brought about? No one knew. But Woodrow Wilson was
determined to try. He would send a personal representative, a peace
emissary, to counsel with the warlords of Europe.
William Jennings Bryan, secretary of state, Bryan, the peace
advocate, longed to go. He saw a chance to perform a great service
and make his name immortal. But Wilson appointed another man, his
intimate friend and advisor Colonel Edward M. House; and it was
House's thorny task to break the unwelcome news to Bryan without
giving him offense.
"Bryan was distinctly disappointed when he heard I was to go to
Europe as the peace emissary," Colonel House records in his diary.
"He said he had planned to do this himself ...
"I replied that the President thought it would be unwise for anyone
to do this officially, and that his going would attract a great deal of
attention and people would wonder why he was there. ..."
You see the intimation? House practically told Bryan that he was too
important for the job - and Bryan was satisfied.
Colonel House, adroit, experienced in the ways of the world, was
following one of the important rules of human relations: Always
make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.
Woodrow Wilson followed that policy even when inviting William
Gibbs McAdoo to become a member of his cabinet. That was the
highest honor he could confer upon anyone, and yet Wilson
extended the invitation in such a way as to make McAdoo feel doubly
important. Here is the story in McAdoo's own words: "He [Wilson]
said that he was making up his cabinet and that he would be very
glad if I would accept a place in it as Secretary of the Treasury. He
had a delightful way of putting things; he created the impression
that by accepting this great honor I would be doing him a favor."
Unfortunately, Wilson didn't always employ such taut. If he had,
history might have been different. For example, Wilson didn't make
the Senate and the Republican Party happy by entering the United
States in the League of Nations. Wilson refused to take such
prominent Republican leaders as Elihu Root or Charles Evans Hughes
or Henry Cabot Lodge to the peace conference with him. Instead, he
took along unknown men from his own party. He snubbed the
Republicans, refused to let them feel that the League was their idea
as well as his, refused to let them have a finger in the pie; and, as a
result of this crude handling of human relations, wrecked his own
career, ruined his health, shortened his life, caused America to stay
out of the League, and altered the history of the world.
Statesmen and diplomats aren't the only ones who use this make-aperson-
happy-yo-do-things-you-want-them-to-do approach. Dale O.
Ferrier of Fort Wayne, Indiana, told how he encouraged one of his
young children to willingly do the chore he was assigned.
"One of Jeff's chores was to pick up pears from under the pear tree
so the person who was mowing underneath wouldn't have to stop to
pick them up. He didn't like this chore, and frequently it was either
not done at all or it was done so poorly that the mower had to stop
and pick up several pears that he had missed. Rather than have an
eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation about it, one day I said to him: 'Jeff,
I'll make a deal with you. For every bushel basket full of pears you
pick up, I'll pay you one dollar. But after you are finished, for every
pear I find left in the yard, I'll take away a dollar. How does that
sound?' As you would expect, he not only picked up all of the pears,
but I had to keep an eye on him to see that he didn't pull a few off
the trees to fill up some of the baskets."
I knew a man who had to refuse many invitations to speak,
invitations extended by friends, invitations coming from people to
whom he was obligated; and yet he did it so adroitly that the other
person was at least contented with his refusal. How did he do it? Not
by merely talking about the fact that he was too busy and too-this
and too-that. No, after expressing his appreciation of the invitation
and regretting his inability to accept it, he suggested a substitute
speaker. In other words, he didn't give the other person any time to
feel unhappy about the refusal, He immediately changed the other
person's thoughts to some other speaker who could accept the
invitation.
Gunter Schmidt, who took our course in West Germany, told of an
employee in the food store he managed who was negligent about
putting the proper price tags on the shelves where the items were
displayed. This caused confusion and customer complaints.
Reminders, admonitions, confrontations, with her about this did not
do much good. Finally, Mr. Schmidt called her into his office and told
her he was appointing her Supervisor of Price Tag Posting for the
entire store and she would be responsible for keeping all of the
shelves properly tagged. This new responsibility and title changed
her attitude completely, and she fulfiled her duties satisfactorily from
then on.
Childish? Perhaps. But that is what they said to Napoleon when he
created the Legion of Honor and distributed 15,000 crosses to his
soldiers and made eighteen of his generals "Marshals of France" and
called his troops the "Grand Army." Napoleon was criticized for giving
"toys" to war-hardened veterans, and Napoleon replied, "Men are
ruled by toys."
This technique of giving titles and authority worked for Napoleon and
it will work for you. For example, a friend of mine, Mrs. Ernest Gent
of Scarsdale, New York, was troubled by boys running across and
destroying her lawn. She tried criticism. She tried coaxing. Neither
worked. Then she tried giving the worst sinner in the gang a title and
a feeling of authority. She made him her "detective" and put him in
charge of keeping all trespassers off her lawn. That solved her
problem. Her "detective" built a bonfire in the backyard, heated an
iron red hot, and threatened to brand any boy who stepped on the
lawn.
The effective leader should keep the following guidelines in mind
when it is necessary to change attitudes or behavior:
? 1. Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver.
Forget about the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits
to the other person.
? 2. Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do.
? 3. Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the other person really
wants.
? 4. Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what
you suggest.
? 5. Match those benefits to the other person's wants.
? 6. When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to
the other person the idea that he personally will benefit. We could
give a curt order like this: " John, we have customers coming in
tomorrow and I need the stockroom cleaned out. So sweep it out,
put the stock in neat piles on the shelves and polish the counter." Or
we could express the same idea by showing John the benefits he will
get from doing the task: "John, we have a job that should be
completed right away. If it is done now, we won't be faced with it
later. I am bringing some customers in tomorrow to show our
facilities. I would like to show them the stockroom, but it is in poor
shape. If you could sweep it out, put the stock in neat piles on the
shelves, and polish the counter, it would make us look efficient and
you will have done your part to provide a good company image."
Will John be happy about doing what you suggest? Probably not very
happy, but happier than if you had not pointed out the benefits.
Assuming you know that John has pride in the way his stockroom
looks and is interested in contributing to the company image, he will
be more likely to be cooperative. It also will have been pointed out
to John that the job would have to be done eventually and by doing
it now, he won't be faced with it later.
It is na§áve to believe you will always get a favorable reaction from
other persons when you use these approaches, but the experience of
most people shows that you are more likely to change attitudes this
way than by not using these principles - and if you increase your
successes by even a mere 10 percent, you have become 10 percent
more effective as a leader than you were before - and that is your
benefit.
People are more likely to do what you would like them to do when
you use ...
? Principle 9 - Make the other person happy about doing the thing
you suggest.
In A Nutshell Be A Leader
A leader's job often includes changing your people's attitudes and
behavior. Some suggestions to accomplish this:
? Principle 1 - Begin with praise and honest appreciation.
? Principle 2 - Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly.
? Principle 3 - Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the
other person.
? Principle 4 - Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.
? Principle 5 - Let the other person save face.
? Principle 6 - Praise the slightest improvement and praise every
improvement. Be "hearty in your approbation and lavish in your
praise."
? Principle 7 - Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.
? Principle 8 - Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to
correct.
? Principle 9 - Make the other person happy about doing the thing
you suggest.

Part 5 - Letters That Produced Miraculous Results
I'll Bet I know what you are thinking now. You are probably saying to
yourself something like this: " 'Letters that produced miraculous
results!' Absurd! Smacks of patent-medicine advertising!"
It you are thinking that, I don't blame you. I would probably have
thought that myself if I had picked up a book like this fifteen years
ago. Sceptical? Well, I like sceptical people. I spent the first twenty
years of my life in Missouri¡ªand I like people who have to be shown.
Almost all the progress ever made in human thought has been made
by the Doubting Thomases, the questioners, the challengers, the
show-me crowd.
Let's be honest. Is the title, "Letters That Produced Miraculous
Results," accurate? No, to be frank with you, it isn't. The truth is, it is
a deliberate understatement of fact. Some of the letters reproduced
in this chapter harvested results that were rated twice as good as
miracles. Rated by whom? By Ken R. Dyke, one of the best-known
sales promotion men in America, formerly sales promotion manager
for Johns-Manville, and now advertising manager for Colgate-
Palmolive Peet Company and Chairman of the Board of the
Association of National Advertisers.
Mr Dykes says that letters he used to send out, asking for
information from dealers, seldom brought more than a return of 5 to
8 per cent. He said he would have regarded a 15 per cent response
as most extraordinary, and told me that, if his replies had ever
soared to 20 per cent, he would have regarded it as nothing short of
a miracle.
But one of Mr Dyke's letters, printed in this chapter, brought 42 1/2
per cent; in other words, that letter was twice as good as a miracle.
You can't laugh that off. And this letter wasn't a sport, a fluke, an
accident. Similar results were obtained from scores of other letters.
How did he do it? Here is the explanation in Ken Dyke's own words:
"This astonishing increase in the effectiveness of letters occurred
immediately after I attended Mr Carnegie's course in 'Effective
Speaking and Human Relations.' I saw that the approach I had
formerly used was all wrong. I tried to apply the principles taught in
this book¡ªand they resulted in an increase of from 500 to 800 per
cent in the effectiveness of my letters asking for information."
Here is the letter. It pleases the other man by asking him to do the
writer a small favour¡ªa favour that makes him feel important. My
own comments on the letter appear in parentheses. Mr John Blank,
Blankville, Indiana. Dear Mr Blank:
I wonder if you would mind helping me out of a little difficulty?
(Let's get the picture clear. Imagine a lumber dealer in Indiana
receiving a letter from an executive of the Johns-Manville Company;
and in the first line of the letter, this high-priced executive in New
York asks the other fellow to help him out of a difficulty. I can
imagine the dealer in Indiana saying to himself something like this:
"Well, if this chap in New York is in trouble, he has certainly come to
the right person. I always try to be generous and help people. Let's
see what's wrong with him!")
Last year, I succeeded in convincing our company that what our
dealers needed most to help increase their re-roofing sales was a
year 'round direct-mail campaign paid for entirely by Johns-Manville.
(The dealer out in Indiana probably says, "Naturally, they ought to
pay for it. They're hogging most of the profit as it is. They're making
millions while I'm having hard scratchin' to pay the rent. ... Now
what is this fellow in trouble about?")
Recently I mailed a questionnaire to the 1,600 dealers who had used
the plan and certainly was very much pleased with the hundreds of
replies which showed that they appreciated this form of co-operation
and found it most helpful.
On the strength of this, we have just released our new direct-mail
plan which I know you'll like still better.
But this morning our president discussed with me my report of last
year's plan and, as presidents will, asked me how much business I
could trace to it. Naturally, I must come to you to help me answer
him.
(That's a good phrase: "I must come to you to help me answer him."
The big shot in New York is telling the truth, and he is giving the
Johns-Manville dealer in Indiana honest, sincere recognition. Note
that Ken Dyke doesn't waste any time talking about how important
his company is. Instead, he immediately shows the other fellow how
much he has to lean on him. Ken Dyke admits that he can't even
make a report to the president of Johns-Manville without the dealer's
help. Naturally, the dealer out in Indiana, being human, likes that
kind of talk.)
What I'd like you to do is (1) to tell me, on the enclosed postcard,
how many roofing and re-roofing jobs you feel last year's direct-mail
plan helped you secure, and (2) give me, as nearly as you can, their
total estimated value in dollars and cents (based on the total cost of
the jobs applied).
If you'll do this, I'll surely appreciate it and thank you for your
kindness in giving me this information.
Sincerely, KEN R. DYKE, Sales Promotion Manager
(Note how, in the last paragraph, he whispers "I" and shouts "You."
Note how generous he is in his praise: "Surely appreciate," "thank
you," "your kindness.")
Simple letter, isn't it? But it produced "miracles" by asking the other
person to do a small favour¡ªthe performing of which gave him a
feeling of importance.
That psychology will work, regardless of whether you are selling
asbestos roofs or touring Europe in a Ford.
To illustrate. Homer Croy and I once lost our way while motoring
through the interior of France. Halting our old Model T, we asked a
group of peasants how we could get to the next big town.
The effect of the question was electrical. These peasants, wearing
wooden shoes, regarded all Americans as rich. And automobiles were
rare in those regions, extremely rare. Americans touring through
France in a car! Surely we must be millionaires. Maybe cousins of
Henry Ford. But they knew something we didn't know. We had more
money than they had; but we had to come to them hat in hand to
find out how to get to the next town. And that gave them a feeling
of importance. They all started talking at once. One chap, thrilled at
this rare opportunity, commanded the others to keep quiet. He
wanted to enjoy all alone the thrill of directing us.
Try this yourself. The next time you are in a strange city, stop
someone who is below you in the economic and social scale and say:
"I wonder if you would mind helping me out of a little difficulty.
Won't you please tell me how to get to such and such a place?"
Benjamin Franklin used this technique to turn a caustic enemy into a
lifelong friend. Franklin, a young man at the time, had all his savings
invested in a small printing business. He managed to get himself
elected clerk of the General Assembly in Philadelphia. That position
gave him the job of doing the official printing. There was good profit
in this job, and Ben was eager to keep it. But a menace loomed
ahead. One of the richest and ablest men in the Assembly disliked
Franklin bitterly. He not only disliked Franklin, but he denounced him
in a public talk.
That was dangerous, very dangerous. So Franklin resolved to make
the man like him. But how? That was a problem. By doing a favour
for his enemy? No, that would have aroused his suspicions, maybe
his contempt. Franklin was too wise, too adroit to be caught in such
a trap. So he did the very opposite. He asked his enemy to do him a
favour.
Franklin didn't ask for a loan of ten dollars. No! No! Franklin asked a
favour that pleased the other man¡ªa favour that touched his vanity,
a favour that gave him recognition, a favour that subtly expressed
Franklin's admiration for his knowledge and achievements. Here is
the balance of the story in Franklin's own words:
Having heard that he had in his library a certain very scarce and
curious book, I wrote a note to him, expressing my desire of
perusing that book and requesting that he would do me the favour of
lending it to me for a few days.
He sent it immediately, and I returned it in about a week with
another note expressing strongly my sense of the favour.
When next we met in the House, he spoke to me (which he had
never done before) and with great civility and he ever afterward
manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that we
became great friends and our friendship continued to his death.
Ben Franklin has been dead now for a hundred and fifty years, but
the psychology that he used, the psychology of asking the other man
to do you a favour, goes marching right on.
For example, it was used with remarkable success by one of my
students, Albert B. Amsel. For years, Mr Amsel, a salesman of
plumbing and heating materials, had been trying to get the trade of
a certain plumber in Brooklyn. This plumber's business was
exceptionally large and his credit unusually good. But Amsel was
licked from the beginning. The plumber was one of those
disconcerting individuals who pride themselves on being rough,
tough, and nasty. Sitting behind his desk with a big cigar tilted in the
corner of his mouth, he snarled at Amsel every time he opened the
door, "Don't need a thing today! Don't waste my time and yours!
Keep moving!"
Then one day Mr Amsel tried a new technique, a technique that split
the account wide open, made a friend, and brought many fine
orders. Amsel's firm was negotiating for the purchase of a new
branch store in Queens Village on Long Island. It was a
neighbourhood the plumber knew well, and one where he did a great
deal of business. So this time, when Mr Amsel called, he said: "Mr
C¡ª¡ª, I'm not here to sell you anything today. I've got to ask you to
do me a favour, if you will. Can you spare me just a minute of your
time?"
"H'm¡ªwell," said the plumber, shifting his cigar. "What's on your
mind? Shoot."
"My firm is thinking of. opening up a branch store over in Queens
Village," Mr Amsel said. "Now, you know that locality as well as
anyone living. So I've come to you to ask what you think about it. Is
it a wise move¡ªor not?"
Here was a new situation! For years this plumber had been getting
his feeling of importance out of snarling at salesmen and ordering
them to keep moving. But here was a salesman begging him for
advice; yes, a salesman from a big concern wanting his opinion as to
what they should do.
"Sit down," he said, pulling forward a chair. And for the next hour,
he expatiated on the peculiar advantages and virtues of the
plumbing market in Queens Village. He not only approved the
location of the store, but he focused his intellect on outlining a
complete course of action for the purchase of the property, the
stocking of supplies, and the opening of trade. He got a feeling of
importance by telling a wholesale plumbing concern how to run its
business. From there, he expanded into personal grounds. He
became friendly, and told Mr Amsel of his intimate domestic
difficulties and household wars.
"By the time I left that evening," Mr Amsel says, "I not only had in
my pocket a large initial order for equipment, but I had laid the
foundations of a solid business friendship. I am playing golf now with
this chap who formerly barked and snarled at me. This change in his
attitude was brought about by my asking him to do me a little favour
that made him feel important."
Let's examine another of Ken Dyke's letters, and again note how
skilfully he applies this "do-me-a-favour" psychology.
A few years ago, Mr Dyke was distressed at his inability to get
business men, contractors, and architects to answer his letters
asking for information.
In those days, he seldom got more than 1 per cent return from his
letters to architects and engineers. He would have regarded 2 per
cent as very good, and 3 per cent as excellent. And 10 per cent?
Why, 10 per cent would have been hailed as a miracle. But the letter
that follows pulled almost 50 per cent. ... Five times as good as a
miracle. And what replies! Letters of two and three pages! Letters
glowing with friendly advice and co-operation.
Here is the letter. You will observe that in the psychology used¡ª
even in the phraseology in some places¡ªthe letter is almost identical
with that quoted on pages 188-89. As you peruse this letter, read
between the lines, try to analyze the feeling of the man who got it.
Find out why it produced results five times as good as a miracle.
Johns-Manville
22 EAST 40th STREET
NEW YORK CITY
Mr John Doe,
617 Doe Street,
Doeville, N.J.
Dear Mr Doe:
I wonder if you'll help me out of a little difficulty?
About a year ago I persuaded our company that one of the things
architects most needed was a catalogue which would give them the
whole story of all J-M building materials and their part in repairing
and remodelling homes.
The attached catalogue resulted¡ªthe first of its kind. But now our
stock is getting low, and when I mentioned it to our president he
said (as presidents will) that he would have no objection to another
edition provided / furnished satisfactory evidence that the catalogue
had done the job for which it was designed.
Naturally, I must come to you for help, and 7 am therefore taking
the liberty of asking you and forty-nine other architects in various
parts of the country to be the jury.
To make it quite easy for you, I have written a few simple questions
on the back of this letter. And I'll certainly regard it as a personal
favour if you'll check the answers, add any comments that you may
wish to make, and then slip this letter into the enclosed stamped
envelope.
Needless to say, this won't obligate you in any way, and I now leave
it to you to say whether the catalogue shall be discontinued or
reprinted with improvements based on your experience and advice.
In any event, rest assured that I shall appreciate your co-operation
very much. Thank you!
Sincerely yours, KEN R. DYKE, Sales Promotion Manager.
Another word of warning. I know from experience that some men,
reading this letter, will try to use the same psychology mechanically.
They will try to boost the other man's ego, not through genuine, real
appreciation, but through flattery and insincerity. And their technique
won't work.
Remember, we all crave appreciation and recognition, and will do
almost anything to get it. But nobody wants insincerity. Nobody
wants flattery.
Let me repeat: the principles taught in this book will work only when
they come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am
talking about a new way of life.

Part VI: Seven Rules for Making Your Home Life Happier
1 - How To Dig Your Marital Grave In The Quickest Possible Way
Seventy-Five years ago, Napoleon III of France, nephew of Napoleon
Bonaparte, fell in love with Marie Eugenic Ignace Augustine de
Montijo, Countess of Teba, the most beautiful woman in the world¡ª
and married her. His advisors pointed out that she was only the
daughter of an insignificant Spanish count. But Napoleon retorted:
"What of it?" Her grace, her youth, her charm, her beauty filled him
with divine felicity. In a speech hurled from the throne, he defied an
entire nation: "I have preferred a woman I love and respect," he
proclaimed, "to a woman unknown to me."
Napoleon and his bride had health, wealth, power, fame, beauty,
love, adoration¡ªall the requirements for a perfect romance. Never
did the sacred fire of marriage glow with a brighter incandescence.
But, alas, the holy flame soon flickered and the incandescence
cooled¡ªand turned to embers. Napoleon could make Eugenic an
empress; but nothing in all la belle France, neither the power of his
love nor the might of his throne, could keep her from nagging.
Bedeviled by jealousy, devoured by suspicion, she flouted his orders,
she denied him even a show of privacy. She broke into his office
while he was engaged in affairs of state. She interrupted his most
important discussions. She refused to leave him alone, always
fearing that he might be consorting with another woman.
Often she ran to her sister, complaining of her husband,
complaining, weeping, nagging, and threatening. Forcing her way
into his study, she stormed at him and abused him. Napoleon,
master of a dozen sumptuous palaces, Emperor of France, could not
find a cupboard in which he could call his soul his own.
And what did Eugenic accomplish by all this? Here is the answer. I
am quoting now from E.A. Rheinhardt's engrossing book, Napoleon
and Eugenic: The Tragicomedy of an Empire: "So it came about that
Napoleon frequently would steal out by a little side door at night,
with a soft hat pulled over his eyes, and, accompanied by one of his
intimates, really betake himself to some fair lady who was expecting
him, or else stroll about the great city as of old, passing through
streets of the kind which an Emperor hardly sees outside a fairy tale,
and breathing the atmosphere of might-have-beens."
That is what nagging accomplished for Eugenic. True, she sat on the
throne of France. True, she was the most beautiful woman in the
world. But neither royalty nor beauty can keep love alive amidst the
poisonous fumes of nagging. Eugenic could have raised her voice like
Job of old and have wailed: "The thing which I greatly feared is
come upon me." Come upon her? She brought it upon herself, poor
woman, by her jealousy and her nagging. Of all the sure-fire, infernal
devices ever invented by all the devils in hell for destroying love,
nagging is the deadliest. It never fails. Like the bite of the king
cobra, it always destroys, always kills.
The wife of Count Leo Tolstoi discovered that¡ªafter it was too late.
Before she passed away, she confessed to her daughters: "I was the
cause of your father's death." Her daughters didn't reply. They were
both crying. They knew their mother was telling the truth. They
knew she had killed him with her constant complaining, her eternal
criticisms, and her eternal nagging. Yet Count Tolstoi and his wife
ought, by all odds, to have been happy. He was one of the most
famous novelists of all time. Two of his masterpieces, War and Peace
and Anna Karenina will forever shine brightly among the literary
glories of earth.
Tolstoi was so famous that his admirers followed him around day
and night and took down in shorthand every word he uttered. Even if
he merely said, "I guess I'll go to bed"; even trivial words like that,
everything was written down; and now the Russian Government is
printing every sentence that he ever wrote; and his combined
writings will fill one hundred volumes.
In addition to fame, Tolstoi and his wife had wealth, social position,
children. No marriage ever blossomed under softer skies. In the
beginning, their happiness seemed too perfect, too intense, to
endure. So kneeling together, they prayed to Almighty God to
continue the ecstasy that was theirs. Then an astonishing thing
happened. Tolstoi gradually changed. He became a totally different
person. He became ashamed of the great books that he had written,
and from that time on he devoted his life to writing pamphlets
preaching peace and the abolition of war and poverty.
This man who had once confessed that in his youth he had
committed every sin imaginable¡ªeven murder¡ªtried to follow
literally the teachings of Jesus. He gave all his lands away and lived a
life of poverty. He worked in the fields, chopping wood and pitching
hay. He made his own shoes, swept his own room, ate out of a
wooden bowl, and tried to love his enemies.
Leo Tolstoi's life was a tragedy, and the cause of his tragedy was his
marriage. His wife loved luxury, but he despised it. She craved fame
and the plaudits of society, but these frivolous things meant nothing
whatever to him. She longed for money and riches, but he believed
that wealth and private property were a sin. For years, she nagged
and scolded and screamed because he insisted on giving away the
right to publish his books freely without paying him any royalties
whatever. She wanted the money those books would produce. When
he opposed her, she threw herself into fits of hysteria, rolling on the
floor with a bottle of opium at her lips, swearing that she was going
to kill herself and threatening to jump down the well.
There is one event in their lives that to me is one of the most
pathetic scenes in history. As I have already, said, they were
gloriously happy when they were first married; but now, forty-eight
years later, he could hardly bear the sight of her. Sometimes of an
evening, this old and heartbroken wife, starving for affection, came
and knelt at his knees and begged him to read aloud to her the
exquisite love passages that he had written about her in his diary
fifty years previously. And as he read of those beautiful, happy days
that were now gone forever, both of them wept. How different, how
sharply different, the realities of life were from the romantic dreams
they had once dreamed in the long ago.
Finally, when he was eighty-two years old, Tolstoi was unable to
endure the tragic unhappiness of his home any longer so he fled
from his wife on a snowy October night in 1910¡ªfled into the cold
and darkness, not knowing where he was going.
Eleven days later, he died of pneumonia in a railway station. And his
dying request was that she should not be permitted to come into his
presence. Such was the price Countess Tolstoi paid for her nagging
and complaining and hysteria.
The reader may feel that she had much to nag about. Granted. But
that is beside the point. The question is: did nagging help her, or did
it make a bad matter infinitely worse? "I really think I was insane."
That is what Countess Tolstoi herself thought about it¡ªafter it was
too late.
The great tragedy of Abraham Lincoln's life also was his marriage.
Not his assassination, mind you, but his marriage. When Booth fired,
Lincoln never realized he had been shot; but he reaped almost daily,
for twenty-three years, what Herndon, his law partner, described as
"the bitter harvest of conjugal infelicity." "Conjugal infelicity?" That is
putting it mildly. For almost a quarter of a century, Mrs Lincoln
nagged and harassed the life out of him.
She was always complaining, always criticizing her husband; nothing
about him was ever right. He was stoop-shouldered, he walked
awkwardly and lifted his feet straight up and down like an Indian.
She complained that there was no spring in his step, no grace to his
movement; and she mimicked his gait and nagged at him to walk
with his toes pointed down, as she had been taught at Madame
Mentelle's boarding school in Lexington.
She didn't like the way his huge ears stood out at right angles from
his head. She even told him that his nose wasn't straight, that his
lower lip stuck out, and he looked consumptive, that his feet and
hands were too large, his head too small.
Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd Lincoln were opposites in every
way: in training, in background, in temperament, in tastes, in mental
outlook. They irritated each other constantly.
"Mrs Lincoln's loud, shrill voice," wrote the late Senator Albert J.
Beveridge, the most distinguished Lincoln authority of this
generation¡ª"Mrs Lincoln's loud shrill voice could be heard across the
street, and her incessant outbursts of wrath were audible to all who
lived near the house. Frequently her anger was displayed by other
means than words, and accounts of her violence are numerous and
unimpeachable."
To illustrate: Mr and Mrs Lincoln, shortly after their marriage, lived
with Mrs Jacob Early¡ªa doctor's widow in Springfield who was forced
to take in boarders.
One morning Mr and Mrs Lincoln were having breakfast when Lincoln
did something that aroused the fiery temper of his wife. What, no
one remembers now. But Mrs Lincoln, in a rage, dashed a cup of hot
coffee into her husband's face. And she did it in front of the other
boarders. Saying nothing, Lincoln sat there in humiliation and silence
while Mrs Early came with a wet towel and wiped off his face and
clothes.
Mrs Lincoln's jealousy was so foolish, so fierce, so incredible, that
merely to read about some of the pathetic and disgraceful scenes
she created in public¡ªmerely reading about them seventy-five years
later makes one gasp with astonishment. She finally went insane;
and perhaps the most charitable thing one can say about her is that
her disposition was probably always affected by incipient insanity.
Did all this nagging and scolding and raging change Lincoln? In one
way, yes. It certainly changed his attitude toward her. It made him
regret his unfortunate marriage, and it made him avoid her presence
as much as possible.
Springfield had eleven attorneys, and they couldn't all make a living
there; so they used to ride horseback from one county seat to
another, following Judge David Davis while he was holding court in
various places. In that way, they managed to pick up business from
all the county seat towns throughout the Eighth Judicial District.
The other attorneys always managed to get back to Springfield each
Saturday and spend the week-end with their families. But Lincoln
didn't. He dreaded to go home: and for three months in the spring,
and again for three months in the autumn, he remained out on the
circuit and never went near Springfield. He kept this up year after
year. Living conditions in the country hotels were often wretched;
but, wretched as they were, he preferred them to his own home and
Mrs Lincoln's constant nagging and wild outbursts of temper.
Such are the results that Mrs Lincoln, the Empress Eugenic, and
Countess Tolstoi obtained by their nagging. They brought nothing
but tragedy into their lives. They destroyed all that they cherished
most.
Bessie Hamburger, who has spent eleven years in the Domestic
Relations Court in New York City, and has reviewed thousands of
cases of desertion, says that one of the chief reasons men leave
home is because their wives nag. Or, as the Boston Post puts it:
"Many a wife has made her own marital grave with a series of little
digs."
So, if you want to keep your home life happy,
? Rule 1 is: Don't, don't nag!!!

2 - Love And Let Live
"I May Commit many follies in life," Disraeli said, "but I never intend
to marry for love." And he didn't. He stayed single until he was
thirty-five, and then he proposed to a rich widow, a widow fifteen
years his senior; a widow whose hair was white with the passing of
fifty winters. Love? Oh, no. She knew he didn't love her. She knew
he was marrying her for her money! So she made just one request:
she asked him to wait a year to give her the opportunity to study his
character. And at the end of that time, she married him.
Sounds pretty prosaic, pretty commercial, doesn't it? Yet
paradoxically enough, Disraeli's marriage was one of the most
glowing successes in all the battered and bespattered annals of
matrimony.
The rich widow that Disraeli chose was neither young, nor beautiful,
nor brilliant. Far from it. Her conversation bubbled with a laughprovoking
display of literary and historical blunders. For example, she
"never knew which came first, the Greeks or the Romans." Her taste
in clothes was bizarre; and her taste in house furnishings was
fantastic. But she was a genius, a positive genius at the most
important thing in marriage: the art of handling men.
She didn't attempt to set up her intellect against Disraeli's. When he
came home bored and exhausted after an afternoon of matching
repartee with witty duchesses, Mary Anne's frivolous patter permitted
him to relax. Home, to his increasing delight, was a place where he
could ease into his mental slippers and bask in the warmth of Mary
Anne's adoration. These hours he spent at home with his ageing wife
were the happiest of his life. She was his helpmate, his confidante,
his advisor. Every night he hurried home from the House of
Commons to tell her the day's news. And¡ªthis is important¡ª
whatever he undertook, Mary Anne simply did not believe he could
fail.
For thirty years, Mary Anne lived for Disraeli, and for him alone. Even
her wealth she valued only because it made his life easier. In return,
she was his heroine. He became an Earl after she died; but, even
while he was still a commoner, he persuaded Queen Victoria to
elevate Mary Anne to the peerage. And so, in 1868, she was made
Viscountess Beaconsfield.
No matter how silly or scatterbrained she might appear in public, he
never criticized her; he never uttered a word of reproach; and if
anyone dared to ridicule her, he sprang to her defence with ferocious
loyalty. Mary Anne wasn't perfect, yet for three decades she never
tired of talking" about her husband, praising him, admiring him.
Result? "We have been married thirty years," Disraeli said, "and I
have never been bored by her." (Yet some people thought because
Mary Anne didn't know history, she must be stupid!)
For his part, Disraeli never made it any secret that Mary Anne was
the most important thing in his life. Result? "Thanks to his kindness,"
Mary Anne used to tell their friends, "my life has been simply one
long scene of happiness." Between them, they had a little joke. "You
know," Disraeli would say, "I only married you for your money
anyhow." And Mary Anne, smiling, would reply, "Yes, but if you had
it to do over again, you'd marry me for love, wouldn't you?" And he
admitted it was true. No, Mary Anne wasn't perfect. But Disraeli was
wise enough to let her be herself.
As Henry James put it: "The first thing to learn in. intercourse with
others is noninterference with their own peculiar ways of being
happy, provided those ways do not assume to interfere by violence
with ours."
That's important enough to repeat: "The first thing to learn in
intercourse with others is noninterference with their own peculiar
ways of being happy ..."
Or, as Leland Foster Wood in his book, Growing Together in the
Family, has observed: "Success in marriage is much more than a
matter of finding the right person; it is also a matter of being the
right person."
So, if you want your home life to be happy,
? Rule 2 is: Don't try to make your partner over.

3 - Do This And You'll Be Looking Up The Time-Tables To Reno
Disraeli's bitterest rival in public life was the great Gladstone. These
two clashed on every debatable subject under the Empire, yet they
had one thing in common; the supreme happiness of their private
lives.
William and Catherine Gladstone lived together for fifty-nine years,
almost three score years glorified with an abiding devotion. I like to
think of Gladstone, the most dignified of England's prime ministers,
clasping his wife's hand and dancing around the hearthrug with her,
singing this song:
A ragamuffin husband and a rantipoling wife,
We'll fiddle it and scrape it
through the ups and downs
of life.
Gladstone, a formidable enemy in public, never criticized at home.
When he came down to breakfast in the morning, only to discover
that the rest of his family was still sleeping, he had a gentle way of
registering his reproach. He raised his voice and filled the house with
a mysterious chant that reminded the other members that England's
busiest man was waiting downstairs for his breakfast, all alone.
Diplomatic, considerate, he rigorously refrained from domestic
criticism.
And so, often, did Catherine the Great. Catherine ruled one of the
largest empires the world has ever known. Over millions of her
subjects she held the power of life and death. Politically, she was
often a cruel tyrant, waging useless wars and sentencing scores of
her enemies to be cut down by firing squads. Yet if the cook burned
the meat, she said nothing. She smiled and ate it with a tolerance
that the average American husband would do well to emulate.
Dorothy Dix, America's premier authority on the causes of marital
unhappiness, declares that more than fifty per cent of all marriages
are failures; and she knows that one of the reasons why so many
romantic dreams break up on the rocks of Reno is criticism¡ªfutile,
heartbreaking criticism.
So, if you want to keep your home life happy, remember Rule 3:
Don't criticize.
And if you are tempted to criticize the children . . . you imagine I am
going to say don't. But I am not. I am merely going to say, before
you criticize them, read one of the classics of American journalism,
"Father Forgets." It appeared originally as an editorial in the People's
Home Journal. We are reprinting it here with the author's
permission¡ªreprinting it as it was condensed in the Reader's Digest:
"Father Forgets" is one of those little pieces which¡ª dashed off in a
moment of sincere feeling¡ªstrikes an echoing chord in so many
readers as to become a perennial reprint favourite. Since its first
appearance, some fifteen years ago, "Father Forgets" has been
reproduced, writes the author, W. Livingston Larned, "in hundreds of
magazines and house organs, and in newspapers the country over. It
has been reprinted almost as extensively in many foreign languages.
I have given personal permission to thousands who wished to read it
from school, church, and lecture platforms. It has been 'on the air'
on countless occasions and programmes. Oddly enough, college
periodicals have used it, and high-school magazines. Sometimes a
little piece seems mysteriously to 'click.' This one certainly did."
Father Forgets
W. Livingston Larned
Listen, son: I am saying this as you lie asleep, one little paw
crumpled under your cheek and the blond curls stickily wet on your
damp forehead. I have stolen into your room alone. Just a few
minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the library, a stifling wave
of remorse swept over me. Guiltily I came to your bedside.
These are the things I was thinking, son: I had been cross to you. I
scolded you as you were dressing for school because you gave your
face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to task for not cleaning
your shoes. I called out angrily when you threw some of your things
on the floor.
At breakfast I found fault, too. You spilled things. You gulped down
your food. You put your elbows on the table. You spread butter too
thick on your bread. And as you started off to play and I made for
my train, you turned and waved a hand and called, "Good-bye,
Daddy!" and I frowned, and said in reply, "Hold your Shoulders
back!"
Then it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came up the
road I spied you, down on your knees, playing marbles. There were
holes in your stockings. I humiliated you before your boy friends by
marching you ahead of me to the house. Stockings were expensive¡ª
and if you had to buy them you would be more careful! Imagine
that, son, from a father!
Do you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how you
came in, timidly, with a sort of hurt look in your eyes? When I
glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you
hesitated at the door. "What is it you want?" I snapped.
You said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous plunge, and
threw your arms around my neck and kissed me, and your small
arms tightened with an affection that God had set blooming in your
heart and which even neglect could not wither. And then you were
gone, pattering up the stairs.
Well, son, it was shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my
hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me. What has habit
been doing to me? The habit of finding fault, of reprimanding¡ªthis
was my reward to you for being a boy. It was not that I did not love
you; it was that I expected too much of youth. It was measuring you
by the yardstick of my own years.
And there was so much that was good and fine and true in your
character. The little heart of you was as big as the dawn itself over
the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous impulse to rush
in and kiss me goodnight. Nothing else matters tonight, son. I have
come to your bedside in the darkness, and I have knelt there,
ashamed!
It is a feeble atonement; I know you would not understand these
things if I told them to you during your waking hours. But tomorrow
I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer when you
suffer, and laugh when you laugh. I will bite my tongue when
impatient words come. I will keep saying as if it were a ritual: "He is
nothing but a boy¡ªa little boy!"
I am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you now,
son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that you are still a baby.
Yesterday you were in your mother's arms, your head on her
shoulder. I have asked too much, too much.

4 - A Quick Way To Make Everybody Happy
"Most Men when seeking wives," says Paul Popenoe, Director of the
Institute of Family Relations in Los Angeles, "are not looking for
executives but for someone with allure and willingness to flatter their
vanity and make them feel superior. Hence the woman office
manager may be invited to luncheon, once. But she quite possibly
dishes out warmed-over remnants of her college courses on 'main
currents in contemporary philosophy,' and may even insist on paying
her own bill. Result: she thereafter lunches alone.
"In contrast, the noncollegiate typist, when invited to luncheon, fixes
an incandescent gaze on her escort and says yearningly, 'Now tell
me some more about yourself.' Result: he tells the other fellows that
'she's no raving beauty, but I have never met a better talker.'"
Men should express their appreciation of a woman's effort to look
well and dress becomingly. All men forget, if they have ever realized
it, how profoundly women are interested in clothes. For example, if a
man and woman meet another man and woman on the street, the
woman seldom looks at the other man; she usually looks to see how
well the other woman is dressed.
My grandmother died a few years ago at the age of ninety-eight.
Shortly before her death, we showed her a photograph of herself
that had been taken a third of a century earlier. Her failing eyes
couldn't see the picture very well, and the only question she asked
was: "What dress did I have on?" Think of it! An old woman in her
last December, bedridden, weary with age as she lay within the
shadow of the century mark, her memory fading so fast that she was
no longer able to recognize even her own daughters, still interested
in knowing what dress she had worn a third of a century before! I
was at her bedside when she asked that question. It left an
impression on me that will never fade.
The men who are reading these lines can't remember what suits or
shirts they wore five years ago, and they haven't the remotest desire
to remember them. But women¡ªthey are different, and we
American men ought to recognize it. French boys of the upper class
are trained to express their admiration of a woman's frock and
chapeau, not only once but many times during an evening. And fifty
million Frenchmen can't be wrong!
I have among my clippings a story that I know never happened, but
it illustrates a truth, so I'll repeat it:
According to this silly story, a farm woman, at the end of a heavy
day's work, set before her men folks a heaping pile of hay. And when
they indignantly demanded whether she'd gone crazy, she replied:
"Why, how did I know you'd notice? I've been cooking for you men
for the last twenty years, and in all that time I ain't heard no word to
let me know you wasn't just eating hay!"
The pampered aristocrats of Moscow and St Petersburg used to have
better manners; in the Russia of the Czars, it was the custom of the
upper classes, when they had enjoyed a fine dinner, to insist on
having the cook brought into the dining room to receive their
congratulations.
Why not have as much consideration for your wife? The next time
the fried chicken is done to a tender turn, tell her so. Let her know
that you appreciate the fact that you're not just eating hay. Or, as
Texas Guinan used to say, "Give the little girl a great big hand."
And while you're about it, don't be afraid to let her know how
important she is to your happiness. Disraeli was as great a
statesman as England ever produced; yet, as we've seen, he wasn't
ashamed to let the world know how much he "owed to the little
woman."
Just the other day, while perusing a magazine, I came across this.
It's from an interview with Eddie Cantor.
"I owe more to my wife," says Eddie Cantor, "than to anyone else in
the world. She was my best pal as a boy; she helped me to go
straight. And after we married she saved every dollar, and invested
it, and reinvested it. She built up a fortune for me. We have five
lovely children. And she's made a wonderful home for me always. If
I've gotten anywhere, give her the credit."
Out in Hollywood, where marriage is a risk that even Lloyd's of
London wouldn't take a gamble on, one of the few outstandingly
happy marriages is that of the Warner Baxters. Mrs Baxter, the
former Winifred Bryson, gave up a brilliant stage career when she
married. Yet her sacrifice has never been permitted to mar their
happiness. "She missed the applause of stage success," Warner
Baxter says, "but I have tried to see that she is entirely aware of my
applause. If a woman is to find happiness at all in her husband, she
is to find it in his appreciation, and devotion. If that appreciation and
devotion is actual, there is the answer to his happiness also."
There you are. So, if you want to keep your home life happy, one of
the most important rules is
? Rule 4: Give honest appreciation.
~~~~~~~
5 - They Mean So Much To A Woman
From Time immemorial, flowers have been considered the language
of love. They don't cost much, especially in season, and often they're
for sale on the street corners. Yet, considering the rarity with which
the average husband takes home a bunch of daffodils, you might
suppose them to be as expensive as orchids and as hard to come by
as the edelweiss which flowers on the cloud-swept cliffs of the Alps.
Why wait until your wife goes to the hospital to give her a few
flowers? Why not bring her a few roses tomorrow night? You like to
experiment. Try it. See what happens.
George M. Cohan, busy as he was on Broadway, used to telephone
his mother twice a day up to the time of her death. Do you suppose
he had startling news for her each time? No, the meaning of little
attentions is this: it shows the person you love that you are thinking
of her, that you want to please her, and that her happiness and
welfare are very dear, and very near, to your heart.
Women attach a lot of importance to birthdays and anniversaries¡ª
just why, will forever remain one of those feminine mysteries. The
average man can blunder through life without memorizing many
dates, but there are a few which are indispensable: 1492, 1776, the
date of his wife's birthday, and the year and date of his own
marriage. If need be, he can even get along without the first two¡ª
but not the last!
Judge Joseph Sabbath of Chicago, who has reviewed 40,000 marital
disputes and reconciled 2,000 couples, says: "Trivialities are at the
bottom of most marital unhappiness. Such a simple thing as a wife's
waving good-bye to her husband when he goes to work in the
morning would avert a good many divorces."
Robert Browning, whose life with Elizabeth Barrett Browning was
perhaps the most idyllic on record, was never too busy to keep love
alive with little, tributes and attentions. He treated his invalid wife
with such consideration that she once wrote to her sisters: "And now
I begin to wonder naturally whether I may not be some sort of real
angel after all."
Too many men underestimate the value of these small, everyday
attentions. As Gaynor Maddox said in an article in the Pictorial
Review: "The American home really needs a few new vices.
Breakfast in bed, for instance, is one of those amiable dissipations a
greater number of women should be indulged in. Breakfast in bed to
a woman does much the same thing as a private club for a man."
That's what marriage is in the long run¡ªa series of trivial incidents.
And woe to the couple who overlook that fact. Edna St. Vincent
Millay summed it all up once in one of her concise little rhymes:
" 'Tis not love's going hurts my days, But that it went in little ways."
That's a good verse to memorize. Out in Reno, the courts grant
divorces six days a week, at the rate of one every ten marriages.
How many of these marriages do you suppose were wrecked upon
the reef of real tragedy? Mighty few, I'll warrant. If you could sit
there day in, day out, listening to the testimony of those unhappy
husbands and wives, you'd know love "went in little ways."
Take your pocket knife now and cut out this quotation. Paste it inside
your hat or paste it on the mirror, where you will see it every
morning when you shave:
"I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or
any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now.
Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again."
So, if you want to keep your home life happy,
? Rule 5 is: Pay little attentions.
~~~~~~~
6 - If You Want To Be Happy, Don't Neglect This One
Walter Damrosch married the daughter of James G. Blaine, one of
America's greatest orators and one-time candidate for President.
Ever since they met many years ago at Andrew Carnegie's home in
Scotland, the Damroschs have led a conspicuously happy life.
The secret?
"Next to care in choosing a partner,". says Mrs Damrosch, "I should
place courtesy after marriage. If young wives would only be as
courteous to their husbands as to strangers! Any man will run from a
shrewish tongue."
Rudeness is the cancer that devours love. Everyone knows this, yet
it's notorious that we are more polite to strangers than we are to our
own relatives. We wouldn't dream of interrupting strangers to say,
"Good heavens, are you going to tell that old story again!" We
wouldn't dream of opening our friends' mail without permission, or
prying into their personal secrets. And it's only the members of our
own family, those who are nearest and dearest to us, that we dare
insult for their trivial faults.
Again to quote Dorothy Dix: "It is an amazing but true thing that
practically the only people who ever say mean, insulting, wounding
things to us are those of our own households."
"Courtesy," says Henry Clay Risner, "is that quality of heart that
overlooks the broken gate and calls attention to the flowers in the
yard beyond the gate." Courtesy is just as important to marriage as
oil is to your motor.
Oliver Wendell Holmes, the beloved "Autocrat of the Breakfast
Table," was anything but an autocrat in his own home. In fact, he
carried his consideration so far that when he felt melancholy and
depressed, he tried to conceal his blues from the rest of his family. It
was bad enough for him to have to bear them himself, he said,
without inflicting them on the others as well.
That is what Oliver Wendell Holmes did. But what about the average
mortal? Things go wrong at the office; he loses a sale or gets called
on the carpet by the boss. He develops a devastating headache or
misses the five-fifteen; and he can hardly wait till he gets home¡ªto
take it out on the family.
In Holland you leave your shoes outside on the doorstep before you
enter the house. By the Lord Harry, we could learn a lesson from the
Dutch and shed our workaday troubles before we enter our homes.
William James once wrote an essay called "On a Certain Blindness in
Human Beings." It would be worth a special trip to your nearest
library to get that essay and read it. "Now the blindness in human
beings of which this discourse will treat," he wrote, "is the blindness
with which we all are afflicted in regard to the feelings of creatures
and people different from ourselves."
"The blindness with which we all are afflicted." Many men who
wouldn't dream of speaking sharply to a customer, or even to their
partners in business, think nothing of barking at their wives. Yet, for
their personal happiness, marriage is far more important to them, far
more vital, than business.
The average man who is happily married is happier by far than the
genius who lives in solitude. Turgenev, the great Russian novelist,
was acclaimed all over the civilized world. Yet he said: "I would give
up all my genius, and all my books, if there were only some woman,
somewhere, who cared whether or not I came home late for dinner."
What are the chances of happiness in marriage anyway? Dorothy
Dix, as we have already said, believes that more than half of them
are failures; but Dr Paul Popenoe thinks otherwise. He says: "A man
has a better chance of succeeding in marriage than in any other
enterprise he may go into. Of all the men that go into the grocery
business, 70 per cent fail. Of the men and women who enter
matrimony, 70 per cent succeed."
Dorothy Dix sums the whole thing up like this: "Compared with
marriage," she says, "being born is a mere episode in our careers,
and dying a trivial incident.
"No woman can ever understand why a man doesn't put forth the
same effort to make his home a going concern as he does to make
his business or profession a success.
"But, although to have a contented wife and a peaceful and happy
home means more to a man than to make a million dollars, not one
man in a hundred ever gives any real serious thought or makes any
honest effort to make his marriage a success. He leaves the most
important thing in his life to chance, and he wins out or loses,
according to whether fortune is with him or not. Women can never
understand why their husbands refuse to handle them diplomatically,
when it would be money in their pockets to use the velvet glove
instead of the strong-arm method.
"Every man knows that he can jolly his wife into doing anything, and
doing without anything. He knows that if he hands her a few cheap
compliments about what a wonderful manager she is, and how she
helps him, she will squeeze every nickel. Every man knows that if he
tells his wife how beautiful and lovely she looks in her last year's
dress, she wouldn't trade it for the latest Paris importation. Every
man knows that he can kiss his wife's eyes shut until she will be
blind as a bat, and that he has only to give her a warm smack on the
lips to make her dumb as an oyster.
"And every wife knows that her husband knows these things about
her, because she has furnished him with a complete diagram about
how to work her. And she never knows whether to be mad at him or
disgusted with him, because he would rather fight with her and pay
for it in having to eat bad meals, and have his money wasted, and
buy her new frocks and limousines and pearls, than to take the
trouble to flatter her a little and treat her the way she is begging to
be treated."
So, if you want to keep your home life happy.
? Rule 6 is: Be courteous.

7 - Don't Be A "Marriage Illiterate"
Dr Katherine Bement Davis, general secretary of the Bureau of Social
Hygiene, once induced a thousand married women to reply very
frankly to a set of intimate questions. The result was shocking¡ªan
incredibly shocking comment upon the sexual unhappiness of the
average American adult. After perusing the answers she received
from these thousand married women, Dr Davis published without
hesitation her conviction that one of the chief causes of divorce in
this country is physical mismating.
Dr G. V. Hamilton's survey verifies this finding. Dr Hamilton spent
four years studying the marriages of one hundred men and one
hundred women. He asked these men and women individually
something like four hundred questions concerning their married lives,
and discussed their problems exhaustively¡ªso exhaustively that the
whole investigation took four years. This work was considered so
important sociologically that it was financed by a group of leading
philanthropists. You can read the results of the experiment in What's
Wrong with Marriage? by Dr G.V. Hamilton and Kenneth Macgowan.
Well, what is wrong with marriage? "It would take a very prejudiced
and very reckless psychiatrist," says Dr Hamilton, "to say that most
married friction doesn't find its source in sexual maladjustment. At
any rate, the frictions which arise from other difficulties would be
ignored in many, many cases if the sexual relation itself were
satisfactory."
Dr Paul Popenoe, as head of the Institute of Family Relations in Los
Angeles, has reviewed thousands of marriages and he is one of
America's foremost authorities on home life. According to Dr
Popenoe, failure in marriage is usually due to four causes. He lists
them in this order:
? 1. Sexual maladjustment.
? 2. Difference of opinion as to the way of spending leisure time.
? 3. Financial difficulties.
? 4. Mental, physical, or emotional abnormalities.
Notice that sex comes first; and that, strangely enough, money
difficulties come only third on the list.
All authorities on divorce agree upon the absolute necessity for
sexual compatibility. For example, a few years ago Judge Hoffman of
the Domestic Relations Court of Cincinnati¡ªa man who has listened
to thousands of domestic tragedies¡ªannounced: "Nine out of ten
divorces are caused by sexual troubles."
"Sex," says the famous psychologist, John B. Watson, "is admittedly
the most important subject in life. It is admittedly the thing which
causes the most ship-wrecks in the happiness of men and women."
And I have heard a number of practicing physicians in speeches
before my own classes say practically the same thing. Isn't it pitiful,
then, that in the twentieth century, with all of our books and all of
our education, marriages should be destroyed and lives wrecked by
ignorance concerning this most primal and natural instinct?
The Rev. Oliver M. Butterfield after eighteen years as a Methodist
minister gave up his pulpit to direct the Family Guidance Service in
New York City, and he has probably married as many young people
as any man living. He says:
"Early in my experience as a minister I discovered that, in spite of
romance and good intentions, many couples who come to the
marriage altar are matrimonial illiterates." Matrimonial illiterates!
And he continues: "When you consider that we leave the highly
difficult adjustment of marriage so largely to chance, the marvel is
that our divorce rate is only 16 per cent. An appalling number of
husbands and wives are not really married but simply undivorced:
they live in a sort of purgatory."
"Happy marriages," says Dr Butterfield, "are rarely the product of
chance: they are architectural in that they are intelligently and
deliberately planned."
To assist in this planning, Dr Butterfield has for years insisted that
any couple he marries must discuss with him frankly their plans for
the future. And it was as a result of these discussions that he came
to the conclusion that so many of the high contracting parties were
"matrimonial illiterates."
"Sex," says Dr Butterfield, "is but one of the many satisfactions in
married life, but unless this relationship is right, nothing else can be
right."
But how to get it right? "Sentimental reticence"¡ªI'm still quoting Dr
Butterfield¡ª"must be replaced by an ability to discuss objectively
and with detachment attitudes and practices of married life. There is
no way in which this ability can be better acquired than through a
book of sound learning and good taste. I keep on hand several of
these books in addition to a supply of my own booklet, Marriage and
Sexual Harmony.
"Of all the books that are available, the three that seem to me most
satisfactory for general reading are: The Sex Technique in Marriage
by Isabel E. Hutton; The Sexual Side of Marriage by Max Exner; The
Sex Factor in Marriage by Helena Wright."
So,
? Rule 7 of "How to Make Your Home Life Happier" is: 'Read a good
book on the sexual side of marriage.
Learn about sex from books? Why not? A few years ago, Columbia
University, together with the American Social Hygiene Association,
invited leading educators to come and discuss the sex and marriage
problems of college students. At that conference, Dr Paul Popenoe
said: "Divorce is on the decrease. And one of the reasons it is on the
decrease is that people are reading more of the recognized books on
sex and marriage."
So I sincerely feel that I have no right to complete a chapter on
"How to Make Your Home Life Happier" without recommending a list
of books that deal frankly and in a scientific manner with this tragic
problem.

In its issue for June, 1933, American Magazine printed an article by
Emmet Crozier, "Why Marriages Go Wrong." The following is a
questionnaire reprinted from that article. You may find it worth while
to answer these questions, giving yourself ten points for each
question you can answer in the affirmative.
For Husbands
1. Do you still "court" your wife with an occasional gift of flowers,
with remembrances of her birthday and wedding anniversary, or with
some unexpected attention, some unlooked-for tenderness?
2. Are you careful never to criticize her before others?
3. Do you give her money to spend entirely as she chooses, above
the household expenses?
4. Do you make an effort to understand her varying feminine moods
and help her through periods of fatigue, nerves, and irritability?
5. Do you share at least half of your recreation hours with your wife?
6. Do you tactfully refrain from comparing your wife's cooking or
housekeeping with that of your mother or of Bill Jones' wife, except
to her advantage?
7. Do you take a definite interest in her intellectual life, her clubs and
societies, the books she reads, her views on civic problems?
8. Can you let her dance with and receive friendly attentions from
other men without making jealous remarks?
9. Do you keep alert for opportunities to praise her and express your
admiration for her?
10. Do you thank her for the little jobs she does for you, such as
sewing on a button, darning your socks, and sending your clothes to
the cleaners?
For Wives
1. Do you give your husband complete freedom in his business
affairs, and do you refrain from criticizing his associates, his choice of
a secretary, or the hours he keeps?
2. Do you try your best to make your home interesting and
attractive?
3. Do you vary the household menu so that he never quite knows
what to expect when he sits down to the table?
4. Do you have an intelligent grasp of your husband's business so
you can discuss it with him helpfully?
5. Can you meet financial reverses bravely, cheerfully, without
criticizing your husband for his mistakes or comparing him
unfavourably with more successful men?
6. Do you make a special effort to get along amiably with his mother
or other relatives?
7. Do you dress with an eye for your husband's likes and dislikes in
colour and style?
8. Do you compromise little differences of opinion in the interest of
harmony?
9. Do you make an effort to learn games your husband likes, so you
can share his leisure hours?
10. Do you keep track of the day's news, the new books, and new
ideas, so you can hold your husband's intellectual interest?
