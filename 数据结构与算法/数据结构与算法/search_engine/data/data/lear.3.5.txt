 Enter CORNWALL and EDMUND  CORNWALL  I will have my revenge ere I depart his house. 
 EDMUND  How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus 
 gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think 
 of. 
 CORNWALL  I now perceive, it was not altogether your 
 brother's evil disposition made him seek his death; 
 but a provoking merit, set a-work by a reprovable 
 badness in himself. 
 EDMUND  How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to 
 be just! This is the letter he spoke of, which 
 approves him an intelligent party to the advantages 
 of France: O heavens! that this treason were not, 
 or not I the detector! 
 CORNWALL  o with me to the duchess. 
 EDMUND  If the matter of this paper be certain, you have 
 mighty business in hand. 
 CORNWALL  True or false, it hath made thee earl of 
 Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he 
 may be ready for our apprehension. 
 EDMUND  [Aside]  If I find him comforting the king, it will 
 stuff his suspicion more fully.--I will persevere in 
 my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore 
 between that and my blood. 
 CORNWALL  I will lay trust upon thee; and thou shalt find a 
 dearer father in my love.
