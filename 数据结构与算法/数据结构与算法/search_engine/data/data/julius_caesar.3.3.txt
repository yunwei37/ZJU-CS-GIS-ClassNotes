 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE III. A street. 
 Enter CINNA the poet  CINNA THE POET  I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar, 
 And things unlucky charge my fantasy: 
 I have no will to wander forth of doors, 
 Yet something leads me forth. 

 Enter Citizens  First Citizen  What is your name? 
 Second Citizen  Whither are you going? 
 Third Citizen  Where do you dwell? 
 Fourth Citizen  Are you a married man or a bachelor? 
 Second Citizen  Answer every man directly. 
 First Citizen  Ay, and briefly. 
 Fourth Citizen  Ay, and wisely. 
 Third Citizen  Ay, and truly, you were best. 
 CINNA THE POET  What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I 
 dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to 
 answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and 
 truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor. 
 Second Citizen  That's as much as to say, they are fools that marry: 
 you'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed; directly. 
 CINNA THE POET  Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral. 
 First Citizen  As a friend or an enemy? 
 CINNA THE POET  As a friend. 
 Second Citizen  That matter is answered directly. 
 Fourth Citizen  For your dwelling,--briefly. 
 CINNA THE POET  Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol. 
 Third Citizen  Your name, sir, truly. 
 CINNA THE POET  Truly, my name is Cinna. 
 First Citizen  Tear him to pieces; he's a conspirator. 
 CINNA THE POET  I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet. 
 Fourth Citizen  Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses. 
 CINNA THE POET  I am not Cinna the conspirator. 
 Fourth Citizen  It is no matter, his name's Cinna; pluck but his 
 name out of his heart, and turn him going. 
 Third Citizen  Tear him, tear him! Come, brands ho! fire-brands: 
 to Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all: some to Decius' 
 house, and some to Casca's; some to Ligarius': away, go!
