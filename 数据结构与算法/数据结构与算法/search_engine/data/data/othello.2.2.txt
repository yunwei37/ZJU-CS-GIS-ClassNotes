 Enter a Herald with a proclamation; People following  Herald  It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant 
 general, that, upon certain tidings now arrived, 
 importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,

 some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and 
 revels his addiction leads him: for, besides these 
 beneficial news, it is the celebration of his
