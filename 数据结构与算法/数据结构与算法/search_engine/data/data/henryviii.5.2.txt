 Enter CRANMER  CRANMER  I hope I am not too late; and yet the gentleman, 
 That was sent to me from the council, pray'd me 
 To make great haste. All fast? what means this? Ho! 
 Who waits there? Sure, you know me? 

 Enter Keeper  Keeper  Yes, my lord; 
 But yet I cannot help you. 
 CRANMER  Why? 

 Enter DOCTOR BUTTS  Keeper  Your grace must wait till you be call'd for. 
 CRANMER  So. 
 DOCTOR BUTTS  [Aside]  This is a piece of malice. I am glad 
 I came this way so happily: the king 
 Shall understand it presently. 

 Exit  CRANMER  [Aside]	'Tis Butts, 
 The king's physician: as he pass'd along, 
 How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me! 
 Pray heaven, he sound not my disgrace! For certain, 
 This is of purpose laid by some that hate me-- 
 God turn their hearts! I never sought their malice-- 
 To quench mine honour: they would shame to make me 
 Wait else at door, a fellow-counsellor, 
 'Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys. But their pleasures 
 Must be fulfill'd, and I attend with patience. 

 Enter the KING HENRY VIII and DOCTOR BUTTS at a window above  DOCTOR BUTTS  I'll show your grace the strangest sight-- 
 KING HENRY VIII  What's that, Butts? 
 DOCTOR BUTTS  I think your highness saw this many a day. 
 KING HENRY VIII  Body o' me, where is it? 
 DOCTOR BUTTS  There, my lord: 
 The high promotion of his grace of Canterbury; 
 Who holds his state at door, 'mongst pursuivants, 
 Pages, and footboys. 
 KING HENRY VIII  Ha! 'tis he, indeed: 
 Is this the honour they do one another? 
 'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought 
 They had parted so much honesty among 'em 
 At least, good manners, as not thus to suffer 
 A man of his place, and so near our favour, 
 To dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures, 
 And at the door too, like a post with packets. 
 By holy Mary, Butts, there's knavery: 
 Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close: 
 We shall hear more anon.
