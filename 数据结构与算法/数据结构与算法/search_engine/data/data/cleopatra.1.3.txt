 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE III. The same. Another room. 
 Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS  CLEOPATRA  Where is he? 
 CHARMIAN  I did not see him since. 
 CLEOPATRA  See where he is, who's with him, what he does: 
 I did not send you: if you find him sad, 
 Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report 
 That I am sudden sick: quick, and return. 

 Exit ALEXAS  CHARMIAN  Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly, 
 You do not hold the method to enforce 
 The like from him. 
 CLEOPATRA  What should I do, I do not? 
 CHARMIAN  In each thing give him way, cross him nothing. 
 CLEOPATRA  Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him. 
 CHARMIAN  Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear: 
 In time we hate that which we often fear. 
 But here comes Antony. 

 Enter MARK ANTONY  CLEOPATRA  I am sick and sullen. 
 MARK ANTONY  I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,-- 
 CLEOPATRA  Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall: 
 It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature 
 Will not sustain it. 
 MARK ANTONY  Now, my dearest queen,-- 
 CLEOPATRA  Pray you, stand further from me. 
 MARK ANTONY  What's the matter? 
 CLEOPATRA  I know, by that same eye, there's some good news. 
 What says the married woman? You may go: 
 Would she had never given you leave to come! 
 Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here: 
 I have no power upon you; hers you are. 
 MARK ANTONY  The gods best know,-- 
 CLEOPATRA  O, never was there queen 
 So mightily betray'd! yet at the first 
 I saw the treasons planted. 
 MARK ANTONY  Cleopatra,-- 
 CLEOPATRA  Why should I think you can be mine and true, 
 Though you in swearing shake the throned gods, 
 Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness, 
 To be entangled with those mouth-made vows, 
 Which break themselves in swearing! 
 MARK ANTONY  Most sweet queen,-- 
 CLEOPATRA  Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going, 
 But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying, 
 Then was the time for words: no going then; 
 Eternity was in our lips and eyes, 
 Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor, 
 But was a race of heaven: they are so still, 
 Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world, 
 Art turn'd the greatest liar. 
 MARK ANTONY  How now, lady! 
 CLEOPATRA  I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know 
 There were a heart in Egypt. 
 MARK ANTONY  Hear me, queen: 
 The strong necessity of time commands 
 Our services awhile; but my full heart 
 Remains in use with you. Our Italy 
 Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius 
 Makes his approaches to the port of Rome: 
 Equality of two domestic powers 
 Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength, 
 Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey, 
 Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace, 
 Into the hearts of such as have not thrived 
 Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten; 
 And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge 
 By any desperate change: my more particular, 
 And that which most with you should safe my going, 
 Is Fulvia's death. 
 CLEOPATRA  Though age from folly could not give me freedom, 
 It does from childishness: can Fulvia die? 
 MARK ANTONY  She's dead, my queen: 
 Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read 
 The garboils she awaked; at the last, best: 
 See when and where she died. 
 CLEOPATRA  O most false love! 
 Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill 
 With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see, 
 In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be. 
 MARK ANTONY  Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know 
 The purposes I bear; which are, or cease, 
 As you shall give the advice. By the fire 
 That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence 
 Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war 
 As thou affect'st. 
 CLEOPATRA  Cut my lace, Charmian, come; 
 But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well, 
 So Antony loves. 
 MARK ANTONY  My precious queen, forbear; 
 And give true evidence to his love, which stands 
 An honourable trial. 
 CLEOPATRA  So Fulvia told me. 
 I prithee, turn aside and weep for her, 
 Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears 
 Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene 
 Of excellent dissembling; and let it look 
 Life perfect honour. 
 MARK ANTONY  You'll heat my blood: no more. 
 CLEOPATRA  You can do better yet; but this is meetly. 
 MARK ANTONY  Now, by my sword,-- 
 CLEOPATRA  And target. Still he mends; 
 But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian, 
 How this Herculean Roman does become 
 The carriage of his chafe. 
 MARK ANTONY  I'll leave you, lady. 
 CLEOPATRA  Courteous lord, one word. 
 Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it: 
 Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it; 
 That you know well: something it is I would, 
 O, my oblivion is a very Antony, 
 And I am all forgotten. 
 MARK ANTONY  But that your royalty 
 Holds idleness your subject, I should take you 
 For idleness itself. 
 CLEOPATRA  'Tis sweating labour 
 To bear such idleness so near the heart 
 As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me; 
 Since my becomings kill me, when they do not 
 Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence; 
 Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly. 
 And all the gods go with you! upon your sword 
 Sit laurel victory! and smooth success 
 Be strew'd before your feet! 
 MARK ANTONY  Let us go. Come; 
 Our separation so abides, and flies, 
 That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me, 
 And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!
