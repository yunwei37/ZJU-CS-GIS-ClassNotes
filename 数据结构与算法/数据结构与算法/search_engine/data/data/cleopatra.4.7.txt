 Alarum. Drums and trumpets. Enter AGRIPPA and others  AGRIPPA  Retire, we have engaged ourselves too far: 
 Caesar himself has work, and our oppression 
 Exceeds what we expected. 

 Exeunt 
 Alarums. Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS wounded  SCARUS  O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed! 
 Had we done so at first, we had droven them home 
 With clouts about their heads. 
 MARK ANTONY  Thou bleed'st apace. 
 SCARUS  I had a wound here that was like a T, 
 But now 'tis made an H. 
 MARK ANTONY  They do retire. 
 SCARUS  We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yet 
 Room for six scotches more. 

 Enter EROS  EROS  They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves 
 For a fair victory. 
 SCARUS  Let us score their backs, 
 And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind: 
 'Tis sport to maul a runner. 
 MARK ANTONY  I will reward thee 
 Once for thy spritely comfort, and ten-fold 
 For thy good valour. Come thee on. 
 SCARUS  I'll halt after.
