 Enter AGAMEMNON, AJAX, MENELAUS, NESTOR, DIOMEDES, and others, marching. Shouts within  AGAMEMNON  Hark! hark! what shout is that? 
 NESTOR  Peace, drums! 

 Within  Achilles! Achilles! Hector's slain! Achilles. 
 DIOMEDES  The bruit is, Hector's slain, and by Achilles. 
 AJAX  If it be so, yet bragless let it be; 
 Great Hector was a man as good as he. 
 AGAMEMNON  March patiently along: let one be sent 
 To pray Achilles see us at our tent. 
 If in his death the gods have us befriended, 
 Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.
