 Enter CHARLES, BURGUNDY, ALENCON, BASTARD OF ORLEANS, REIGNIER, JOAN LA PUCELLE, and forces  CHARLES  These news, my lord, may cheer our drooping spirits: 
 'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt 
 And turn again unto the warlike French. 
 ALENCON  Then march to Paris, royal Charles of France, 
 And keep not back your powers in dalliance. 
 JOAN LA PUCELLE  Peace be amongst them, if they turn to us; 
 Else, ruin combat with their palaces! 

 Enter Scout  Scout  Success unto our valiant general, 
 And happiness to his accomplices! 
 CHARLES  What tidings send our scouts? I prithee, speak. 
 Scout  The English army, that divided was 
 Into two parties, is now conjoined in one, 
 And means to give you battle presently. 
 CHARLES  Somewhat too sudden, sirs, the warning is; 
 But we will presently provide for them. 
 BURGUNDY  I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there: 
 Now he is gone, my lord, you need not fear. 
 JOAN LA PUCELLE  Of all base passions, fear is most accursed. 
 Command the conquest, Charles, it shall be thine, 
 Let Henry fret and all the world repine. 
 CHARLES  Then on, my lords; and France be fortunate!
