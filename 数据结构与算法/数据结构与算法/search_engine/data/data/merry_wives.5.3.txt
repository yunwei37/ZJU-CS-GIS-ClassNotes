 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE III. A street leading to the Park. 
 Enter MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and DOCTOR CAIUS  MISTRESS PAGE  Master doctor, my daughter is in green: when you 
 see your time, take her by the band, away with her 
 to the deanery, and dispatch it quickly. Go before 
 into the Park: we two must go together. 
 DOCTOR CAIUS  I know vat I have to do. Adieu. 
 MISTRESS PAGE  Fare you well, sir. 

 Exit DOCTOR CAIUS  My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of 
 Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's marrying 
 my daughter: but 'tis no matter; better a little 
 chiding than a great deal of heart-break. 
 MISTRESS FORD  Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies, and the 
 Welsh devil Hugh? 
 MISTRESS PAGE  They are all couched in a pit hard by Herne's oak, 
 with obscured lights; which, at the very instant of 
 Falstaff's and our meeting, they will at once 
 display to the night. 
 MISTRESS FORD  That cannot choose but amaze him. 
 MISTRESS PAGE  If he be not amazed, he will be mocked; if he be 
 amazed, he will every way be mocked. 
 MISTRESS FORD  We'll betray him finely. 
 MISTRESS PAGE  Against such lewdsters and their lechery 
 Those that betray them do no treachery. 
 MISTRESS FORD  The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak!
