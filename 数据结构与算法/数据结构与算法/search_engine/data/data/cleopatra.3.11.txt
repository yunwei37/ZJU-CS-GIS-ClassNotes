 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE XI. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace. 
 Enter MARK ANTONY with Attendants  MARK ANTONY  Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't; 
 It is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither: 
 I am so lated in the world, that I 
 Have lost my way for ever: I have a ship 
 Laden with gold; take that, divide it; fly, 
 And make your peace with Caesar. 
 All  Fly! not we. 
 MARK ANTONY  I have fled myself; and have instructed cowards 
 To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone; 
 I have myself resolved upon a course 
 Which has no need of you; be gone: 
 My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O, 
 I follow'd that I blush to look upon: 
 My very hairs do mutiny; for the white 
 Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them 
 For fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shall 
 Have letters from me to some friends that will 
 Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad, 
 Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint 
 Which my despair proclaims; let that be left 
 Which leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway: 
 I will possess you of that ship and treasure. 
 Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now: 
 Nay, do so; for, indeed, I have lost command, 
 Therefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by. 

 Sits down 
 Enter CLEOPATRA led by CHARMIAN and IRAS; EROS following  EROS  Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him. 
 IRAS  Do, most dear queen. 
 CHARMIAN  Do! why: what else? 
 CLEOPATRA  Let me sit down. O Juno! 
 MARK ANTONY  No, no, no, no, no. 
 EROS  See you here, sir? 
 MARK ANTONY  O fie, fie, fie! 
 CHARMIAN  Madam! 
 IRAS  Madam, O good empress! 
 EROS  Sir, sir,-- 
 MARK ANTONY  Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept 
 His sword e'en like a dancer; while I struck 
 The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I 
 That the mad Brutus ended: he alone 
 Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practise had 
 In the brave squares of war: yet now--No matter. 
 CLEOPATRA  Ah, stand by. 
 EROS  The queen, my lord, the queen. 
 IRAS  Go to him, madam, speak to him: 
 He is unqualitied with very shame. 
 CLEOPATRA  Well then, sustain him: O! 
 EROS  Most noble sir, arise; the queen approaches: 
 Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but 
 Your comfort makes the rescue. 
 MARK ANTONY  I have offended reputation, 
 A most unnoble swerving. 
 EROS  Sir, the queen. 
 MARK ANTONY  O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See, 
 How I convey my shame out of thine eyes 
 By looking back what I have left behind 
 'Stroy'd in dishonour. 
 CLEOPATRA  O my lord, my lord, 
 Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought 
 You would have follow'd. 
 MARK ANTONY  Egypt, thou knew'st too well 
 My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings, 
 And thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spirit 
 Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that 
 Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods 
 Command me. 
 CLEOPATRA  O, my pardon! 
 MARK ANTONY  Now I must 
 To the young man send humble treaties, dodge 
 And palter in the shifts of lowness; who 
 With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased, 
 Making and marring fortunes. You did know 
 How much you were my conqueror; and that 
 My sword, made weak by my affection, would 
 Obey it on all cause. 
 CLEOPATRA  Pardon, pardon! 
 MARK ANTONY  Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates 
 All that is won and lost: give me a kiss; 
 Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster; 
 Is he come back? Love, I am full of lead. 
 Some wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knows 
 We scorn her most when most she offers blows.
