 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE III. The Duke of Albany's palace. 
 Enter GONERIL, and OSWALD, her steward  GONERIL  Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool? 
 OSWALD  Yes, madam. 
 GONERIL  By day and night he wrongs me; every hour 
 He flashes into one gross crime or other, 
 That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it: 
 His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us 
 On every trifle. When he returns from hunting, 
 I will not speak with him; say I am sick: 
 If you come slack of former services, 
 You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer. 
 OSWALD  He's coming, madam; I hear him. 

 Horns within  GONERIL  Put on what weary negligence you please, 
 You and your fellows; I'll have it come to question: 
 If he dislike it, let him to our sister, 
 Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one, 
 Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man, 
 That still would manage those authorities 
 That he hath given away! Now, by my life, 
 Old fools are babes again; and must be used 
 With cheques as flatteries,--when they are seen abused. 
 Remember what I tell you. 
 OSWALD  Well, madam. 
 GONERIL  And let his knights have colder looks among you; 
 What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so: 
 I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall, 
 That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister, 
 To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.
