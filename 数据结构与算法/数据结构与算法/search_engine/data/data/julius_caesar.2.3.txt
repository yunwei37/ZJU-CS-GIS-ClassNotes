 Enter ARTEMIDORUS, reading a paper  ARTEMIDORUS  'Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius; 
 come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna, trust not 
 Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus 
 loves thee not: thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius. 
 There is but one mind in all these men, and it is 
 bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal, 
 look about you: security gives way to conspiracy. 
 The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover, 
 'ARTEMIDORUS.' 
 Here will I stand till Caesar pass along, 
 And as a suitor will I give him this. 
 My heart laments that virtue cannot live 
 Out of the teeth of emulation. 
 If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live; 
 If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.
