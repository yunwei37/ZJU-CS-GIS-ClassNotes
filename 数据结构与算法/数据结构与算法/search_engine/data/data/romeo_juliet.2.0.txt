 Enter Chorus  Chorus  Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie, 
 And young affection gapes to be his heir; 
 That fair for which love groan'd for and would die, 
 With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair. 
 Now Romeo is beloved and loves again, 
 Alike betwitched by the charm of looks, 
 But to his foe supposed he must complain, 
 And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks: 
 Being held a foe, he may not have access 
 To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear; 
 And she as much in love, her means much less 
 To meet her new-beloved any where: 
 But passion lends them power, time means, to meet 
 Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
