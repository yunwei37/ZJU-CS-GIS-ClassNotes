 Enter PROTEUS and JULIA  PROTEUS  Have patience, gentle Julia. 
 JULIA  I must, where is no remedy. 
 PROTEUS  When possibly I can, I will return. 
 JULIA  If you turn not, you will return the sooner. 
 Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake. 

 Giving a ring  PROTEUS  Why then, we'll make exchange; here, take you this. 
 JULIA  And seal the bargain with a holy kiss. 
 PROTEUS  Here is my hand for my true constancy; 
 And when that hour o'erslips me in the day 
 Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake, 
 The next ensuing hour some foul mischance 
 Torment me for my love's forgetfulness! 
 My father stays my coming; answer not; 
 The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears; 
 That tide will stay me longer than I should. 
 Julia, farewell! 

 Exit JULIA  What, gone without a word? 
 Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak; 
 For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it. 

 Enter PANTHINO  PANTHINO  Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for. 
 PROTEUS  Go; I come, I come. 
 Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.
