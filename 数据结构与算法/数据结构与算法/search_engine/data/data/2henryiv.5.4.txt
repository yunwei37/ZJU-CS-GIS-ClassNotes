 Enter Beadles, dragging in HOSTESS QUICKLY and DOLL TEARSHEET  MISTRESS QUICKLY  No, thou arrant knave; I would to God that I might 
 die, that I might have thee hanged: thou hast 
 drawn my shoulder out of joint. 
 First Beadle  The constables have delivered her over to me; and 
 she shall have whipping-cheer enough, I warrant 
 her: there hath been a man or two lately killed about her. 
 DOLL TEARSHEET  Nut-hook, nut-hook, you lie. Come on; I 'll tell 
 thee what, thou damned tripe-visaged rascal, an 
 the child I now go with do miscarry, thou wert 
 better thou hadst struck thy mother, thou 
 paper-faced villain. 
 MISTRESS QUICKLY  O the Lord, that Sir John were come! he would make 
 this a bloody day to somebody. But I pray God the 
 fruit of her womb miscarry! 
 First Beadle  If it do, you shall have a dozen of cushions again; 
 you have but eleven now. Come, I charge you both go 
 with me; for the man is dead that you and Pistol 
 beat amongst you. 
 DOLL TEARSHEET  I'll tell you what, you thin man in a censer, I 
 will have you as soundly swinged for this,--you 
 blue-bottle rogue, you filthy famished correctioner, 
 if you be not swinged, I'll forswear half-kirtles. 
 First Beadle  Come, come, you she knight-errant, come. 
 MISTRESS QUICKLY  O God, that right should thus overcome might! 
 Well, of sufferance comes ease. 
 DOLL TEARSHEET  Come, you rogue, come; bring me to a justice. 
 MISTRESS QUICKLY  Ay, come, you starved blood-hound. 
 DOLL TEARSHEET  Goodman death, goodman bones! 
 MISTRESS QUICKLY  Thou atomy, thou! 
 DOLL TEARSHEET  Come, you thin thing; come you rascal. 
 First Beadle  Very well.
