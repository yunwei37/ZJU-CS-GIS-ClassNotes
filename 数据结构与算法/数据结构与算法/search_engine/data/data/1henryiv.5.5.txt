 Previous scene  SCENE V. Another part of the field. 
 The trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE  HENRY, LORD JOHN LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND, with WORCESTER and VERNON prisoners  KING HENRY IV  Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke. 
 Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace, 
 Pardon and terms of love to all of you? 
 And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary? 
 Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust? 
 Three knights upon our party slain to-day, 
 A noble earl and many a creature else 
 Had been alive this hour, 
 If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne 
 Betwixt our armies true intelligence. 
 EARL OF WORCESTER  What I have done my safety urged me to; 
 And I embrace this fortune patiently, 
 Since not to be avoided it falls on me. 
 KING HENRY IV  Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too: 
 Other offenders we will pause upon. 

 Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON, guarded  How goes the field? 
 PRINCE HENRY  The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw 
 The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him, 
 The noble Percy slain, and all his men 
 Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest; 
 And falling from a hill, he was so bruised 
 That the pursuers took him. At my tent 
 The Douglas is; and I beseech your grace 
 I may dispose of him. 
 KING HENRY IV  With all my heart. 
 PRINCE HENRY  Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you 
 This honourable bounty shall belong: 
 Go to the Douglas, and deliver him 
 Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free: 
 His valour shown upon our crests to-day 
 Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds 
 Even in the bosom of our adversaries. 
 LANCASTER  I thank your grace for this high courtesy, 
 Which I shall give away immediately. 
 KING HENRY IV  Then this remains, that we divide our power. 
 You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland 
 Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed, 
 To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop, 
 Who, as we hear, are busily in arms: 
 Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales, 
 To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March. 
 Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway, 
 Meeting the cheque of such another day: 
 And since this business so fair is done, 
 Let us not leave till all our own be won. 

 Exeunt
