 Flourish. Enter the DUKE of Florence, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, Soldiers, Drum, and Trumpets  DUKE  The general of our horse thou art; and we, 
 Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence 
 Upon thy promising fortune. 
 BERTRAM  Sir, it is 
 A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet 
 We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake 
 To the extreme edge of hazard. 
 DUKE  Then go thou forth; 
 And fortune play upon thy prosperous helm, 
 As thy auspicious mistress! 
 BERTRAM  This very day, 
 Great Mars, I put myself into thy file: 
 Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove 
 A lover of thy drum, hater of love.
