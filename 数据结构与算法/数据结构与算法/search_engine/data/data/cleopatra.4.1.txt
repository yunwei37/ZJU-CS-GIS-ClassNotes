 Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS, with his Army; OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter  OCTAVIUS CAESAR  He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power 
 To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger 
 He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat, 
 Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know 
 I have many other ways to die; meantime 
 Laugh at his challenge. 
 MECAENAS  Caesar must think, 
 When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted 
 Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now 
 Make boot of his distraction: never anger 
 Made good guard for itself. 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  Let our best heads 
 Know, that to-morrow the last of many battles 
 We mean to fight: within our files there are, 
 Of those that served Mark Antony but late, 
 Enough to fetch him in. See it done: 
 And feast the army; we have store to do't, 
 And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!
