 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house. 
 Enter ANGELO and ESCALUS  ESCALUS  Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other. 
 ANGELO  In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions 
 show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be 
 not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and 
 redeliver our authorities there 
 ESCALUS  I guess not. 
 ANGELO  And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his 
 entering, that if any crave redress of injustice, 
 they should exhibit their petitions in the street? 
 ESCALUS  He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of 
 complaints, and to deliver us from devices 
 hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand 
 against us. 
 ANGELO  Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes 
 i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give 
 notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet 
 him. 
 ESCALUS  I shall, sir. Fare you well. 
 ANGELO  Good night. 

 Exit ESCALUS  This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant 
 And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid! 
 And by an eminent body that enforced 
 The law against it! But that her tender shame 
 Will not proclaim against her maiden loss, 
 How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no; 
 For my authority bears of a credent bulk, 
 That no particular scandal once can touch 
 But it confounds the breather. He should have lived, 
 Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense, 
 Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge, 
 By so receiving a dishonour'd life 
 With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived! 
 A lack, when once our grace we have forgot, 
 Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.
