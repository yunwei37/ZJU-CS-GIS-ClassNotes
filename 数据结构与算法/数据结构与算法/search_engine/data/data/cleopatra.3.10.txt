 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE X. Another part of the plain. 
 CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way over  the stage; and TAURUS, the lieutenant of OCTAVIUS  CAESAR, the other way. After their going in, is heard the noise of a sea-fight 
 Alarum. Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  Naught, naught all, naught! I can behold no longer: 
 The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral, 
 With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder: 
 To see't mine eyes are blasted. 

 Enter SCARUS  SCARUS  Gods and goddesses, 
 All the whole synod of them! 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  What's thy passion! 
 SCARUS  The greater cantle of the world is lost 
 With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away 
 Kingdoms and provinces. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  How appears the fight? 
 SCARUS  On our side like the token'd pestilence, 
 Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,-- 
 Whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight, 
 When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd, 
 Both as the same, or rather ours the elder, 
 The breese upon her, like a cow in June, 
 Hoists sails and flies. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  That I beheld: 
 Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not 
 Endure a further view. 
 SCARUS  She once being loof'd, 
 The noble ruin of her magic, Antony, 
 Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard, 
 Leaving the fight in height, flies after her: 
 I never saw an action of such shame; 
 Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before 
 Did violate so itself. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  Alack, alack! 

 Enter CANIDIUS  CANIDIUS  Our fortune on the sea is out of breath, 
 And sinks most lamentably. Had our general 
 Been what he knew himself, it had gone well: 
 O, he has given example for our flight, 
 Most grossly, by his own! 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  Ay, are you thereabouts? 
 Why, then, good night indeed. 
 CANIDIUS  Toward Peloponnesus are they fled. 
 SCARUS  'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend 
 What further comes. 
 CANIDIUS  To Caesar will I render 
 My legions and my horse: six kings already 
 Show me the way of yielding. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  I'll yet follow 
 The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason 
 Sits in the wind against me.
