 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE III. Gloucester's castle. 
 Enter GLOUCESTER and EDMUND  GLOUCESTER  Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural 
 dealing. When I desire their leave that I might 
 pity him, they took from me the use of mine own 
 house; charged me, on pain of their perpetual 
 displeasure, neither to speak of him, entreat for 
 him, nor any way sustain him. 
 EDMUND  Most savage and unnatural! 
 GLOUCESTER  Go to; say you nothing. There's a division betwixt 
 the dukes; and a worse matter than that: I have 
 received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to be 
 spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet: 
 these injuries the king now bears will be revenged 
 home; there's part of a power already footed: we 
 must incline to the king. I will seek him, and 
 privily relieve him: go you and maintain talk with 
 the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived: 
 if he ask for me. I am ill, and gone to bed. 
 Though I die for it, as no less is threatened me, 
 the king my old master must be relieved. There is 
 some strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you, be careful. 

 Exit  EDMUND  This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke 
 Instantly know; and of that letter too: 
 This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me 
 That which my father loses; no less than all: 
 The younger rises when the old doth fall.
