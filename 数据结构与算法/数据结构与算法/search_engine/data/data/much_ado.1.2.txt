 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE II. A room in LEONATO's house. 
 Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, meeting  LEONATO  How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son? 
 hath he provided this music? 
 ANTONIO  He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell 
 you strange news that you yet dreamt not of. 
 LEONATO  Are they good? 
 ANTONIO  As the event stamps them: but they have a good 
 cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count 
 Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine 
 orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine: 
 the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my 
 niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it 
 this night in a dance: and if he found her 
 accordant, he meant to take the present time by the 
 top and instantly break with you of it. 
 LEONATO  Hath the fellow any wit that told you this? 
 ANTONIO  A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and 
 question him yourself. 
 LEONATO  No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear 
 itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal, 
 that she may be the better prepared for an answer, 
 if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it. 

 Enter Attendants  Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you 
 mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your 
 skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.
