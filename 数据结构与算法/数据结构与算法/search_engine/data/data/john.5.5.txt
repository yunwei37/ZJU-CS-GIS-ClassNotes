 Enter LEWIS and his train  LEWIS  The sun of heaven methought was loath to set, 
 But stay'd and made the western welkin blush, 
 When English measure backward their own ground 
 In faint retire. O, bravely came we off, 
 When with a volley of our needless shot, 
 After such bloody toil, we bid good night; 
 And wound our tattering colours clearly up, 
 Last in the field, and almost lords of it! 

 Enter a Messenger  Messenger  Where is my prince, the Dauphin? 
 LEWIS  Here: what news? 
 Messenger  The Count Melun is slain; the English lords 
 By his persuasion are again fall'n off, 
 And your supply, which you have wish'd so long, 
 Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands. 
 LEWIS  Ah, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart! 
 I did not think to be so sad to-night 
 As this hath made me. Who was he that said 
 King John did fly an hour or two before 
 The stumbling night did part our weary powers? 
 Messenger  Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord. 
 LEWIS  Well; keep good quarter and good care to-night: 
 The day shall not be up so soon as I, 
 To try the fair adventure of to-morrow.
