 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE V. Fields without the town. 
 Enter DUKE VINCENTIO in his own habit, and FRIAR PETER  DUKE VINCENTIO  These letters at fit time deliver me 

 Giving letters  The provost knows our purpose and our plot. 
 The matter being afoot, keep your instruction, 
 And hold you ever to our special drift; 
 Though sometimes you do blench from this to that, 
 As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house, 
 And tell him where I stay: give the like notice 
 To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus, 
 And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate; 
 But send me Flavius first. 
 FRIAR PETER  It shall be speeded well. 

 Exit 
 Enter VARRIUS  DUKE VINCENTIO  I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste: 
 Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends 
 Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.
