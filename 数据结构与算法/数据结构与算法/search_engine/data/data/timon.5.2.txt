 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE II. Before the walls of Athens. 
 Enter two Senators and a Messenger  First Senator  Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his files 
 As full as thy report? 
 Messenger  have spoke the least: 
 Besides, his expedition promises 
 Present approach. 
 Second Senator  We stand much hazard, if they bring not Timon. 
 Messenger  I met a courier, one mine ancient friend; 
 Whom, though in general part we were opposed, 
 Yet our old love made a particular force, 
 And made us speak like friends: this man was riding 
 From Alcibiades to Timon's cave, 
 With letters of entreaty, which imported 
 His fellowship i' the cause against your city, 
 In part for his sake moved. 
 First Senator  Here come our brothers. 

 Enter the Senators from TIMON  Third Senator  No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect. 
 The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouring 
 Doth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare: 
 Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare.
