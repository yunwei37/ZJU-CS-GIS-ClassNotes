 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE II. A forest near Rome. Horns and cry of hounds heard. 
 Enter TITUS ANDRONICUS, with Hunters,  & c., MARCUS, LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS  TITUS ANDRONICUS  The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey, 
 The fields are fragrant and the woods are green: 
 Uncouple here and let us make a bay 
 And wake the emperor and his lovely bride 
 And rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal, 
 That all the court may echo with the noise. 
 Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours, 
 To attend the emperor's person carefully: 
 I have been troubled in my sleep this night, 
 But dawning day new comfort hath inspired. 

 A cry of hounds and horns, winded in a peal. Enter  SATURNINUS, TAMORA, BASSIANUS, LAVINIA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, and Attendants  Many good morrows to your majesty; 
 Madam, to you as many and as good: 
 I promised your grace a hunter's peal. 
 SATURNINUS  And you have rung it lustily, my lord; 
 Somewhat too early for new-married ladies. 
 BASSIANUS  Lavinia, how say you? 
 LAVINIA  I say, no; 
 I have been broad awake two hours and more. 
 SATURNINUS  Come on, then; horse and chariots let us have, 
 And to our sport. 

 To TAMORA  Madam, now shall ye see 
 Our Roman hunting. 
 MARCUS ANDRONICUS  I have dogs, my lord, 
 Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase, 
 And climb the highest promontory top. 
 TITUS ANDRONICUS  And I have horse will follow where the game 
 Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain. 
 DEMETRIUS  Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound, 
 But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.
