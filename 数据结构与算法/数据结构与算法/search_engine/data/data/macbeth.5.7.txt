 Alarums. Enter MACBETH  MACBETH  They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly, 
 But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he 
 That was not born of woman? Such a one 
 Am I to fear, or none. 

 Enter YOUNG SIWARD  YOUNG SIWARD  What is thy name? 
 MACBETH  Thou'lt be afraid to hear it. 
 YOUNG SIWARD  No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name 
 Than any is in hell. 
 MACBETH  My name's Macbeth. 
 YOUNG SIWARD  The devil himself could not pronounce a title 
 More hateful to mine ear. 
 MACBETH  No, nor more fearful. 
 YOUNG SIWARD  Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword 
 I'll prove the lie thou speak'st. 

 They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain  MACBETH  Thou wast born of woman 
 But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn, 
 Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born. 

 Exit 
 Alarums. Enter MACDUFF  MACDUFF  That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face! 
 If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine, 
 My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still. 
 I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms 
 Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth, 
 Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge 
 I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be; 
 By this great clatter, one of greatest note 
 Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune! 
 And more I beg not. 

 Exit. Alarums 
 Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD  SIWARD  This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd: 
 The tyrant's people on both sides do fight; 
 The noble thanes do bravely in the war; 
 The day almost itself professes yours, 
 And little is to do. 
 MALCOLM  We have met with foes 
 That strike beside us. 
 SIWARD  Enter, sir, the castle.
