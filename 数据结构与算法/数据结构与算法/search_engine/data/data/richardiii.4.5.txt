 Enter DERBY and SIR CHRISTOPHER URSWICK  DERBY  Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me: 
 That in the sty of this most bloody boar 
 My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold: 
 If I revolt, off goes young George's head; 
 The fear of that withholds my present aid. 
 But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now? 
 CHRISTOPHER  At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales. 
 DERBY  What men of name resort to him? 
 CHRISTOPHER  Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier; 
 Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley; 
 Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt, 
 And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew; 
 And many more of noble fame and worth: 
 And towards London they do bend their course, 
 If by the way they be not fought withal. 
 DERBY  Return unto thy lord; commend me to him: 
 Tell him the queen hath heartily consented 
 He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter. 
 These letters will resolve him of my mind. Farewell.
