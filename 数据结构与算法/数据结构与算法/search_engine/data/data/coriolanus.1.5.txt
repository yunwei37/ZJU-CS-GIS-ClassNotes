 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE V. Corioli. A street. 
 Enter certain Romans, with spoils  First Roman  This will I carry to Rome. 
 Second Roman  And I this. 
 Third Roman  A murrain on't! I took this for silver. 

 Alarum continues still afar off 
 Enter MARCIUS and TITUS LARTIUS with a trumpet  MARCIUS  See here these movers that do prize their hours 
 At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons, 
 Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would 
 Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves, 
 Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them! 
 And hark, what noise the general makes! To him! 
 There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius, 
 Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take 
 Convenient numbers to make good the city; 
 Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste 
 To help Cominius. 
 LARTIUS  Worthy sir, thou bleed'st; 
 Thy exercise hath been too violent for 
 A second course of fight. 
 MARCIUS  Sir, praise me not; 
 My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well: 
 The blood I drop is rather physical 
 Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus 
 I will appear, and fight. 
 LARTIUS  Now the fair goddess, Fortune, 
 Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms 
 Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman, 
 Prosperity be thy page! 
 MARCIUS  Thy friend no less 
 Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell. 
 LARTIUS  Thou worthiest Marcius! 

 Exit MARCIUS  Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place; 
 Call thither all the officers o' the town, 
 Where they shall know our mind: away!
