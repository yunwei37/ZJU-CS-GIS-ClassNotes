 SIR HUGH EVANS  Pray you, give me my gown; or else keep it in your arms. 

 Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER  SHALLOW  How now, master Parson! Good morrow, good Sir Hugh. 
 Keep a gamester from the dice, and a good student 
 from his book, and it is wonderful.

 PAGE  'Save you, good Sir Hugh! 
 SIR HUGH EVANS  'Pless you from his mercy sake, all of you! 
 SHALLOW  What, the sword and the word! do you study them 
 both, master parson? 
 PAGE  And youthful still! in your doublet and hose this 
 raw rheumatic day! 
 SIR HUGH EVANS  There is reasons and causes for it. 
 PAGE  We are come to you to do a good office, master parson. 
 SIR HUGH EVANS  Fery well: what is it? 
 PAGE  Yonder is a most reverend gentleman, who, belike 
 having received wrong by some person, is at most 
 odds with his own gravity and patience that ever you 
 saw. 
 SHALLOW  I have lived fourscore years and upward; I never 
 heard a man of his place, gravity and learning, so 
 wide of his own respect. 
 SIR HUGH EVANS  What is he? 
 PAGE  I think you know him; Master Doctor Caius, the 
 renowned French physician. 
 SIR HUGH EVANS  Got's will, and his passion of my heart! I had as 
 lief you would tell me of a mess of porridge. 
 PAGE  Why? 
 SIR HUGH EVANS  He has no more knowledge in Hibocrates and Galen, 
 --and he is a knave besides; a cowardly knave as you 
 would desires to be acquainted withal. 
 PAGE  I warrant you, he's the man should fight with him. 
 SHALLOW  [Aside]  O sweet Anne Page! 
 SHALLOW  It appears so by his weapons. Keep them asunder: 
 here comes Doctor Caius. 

 Enter Host, DOCTOR CAIUS, and RUGBY  PAGE  Nay, good master parson, keep in your weapon. 
 SHALLOW  So do you, good master doctor. 
 Host  Disarm them, and let them question: let them keep 
 their limbs whole and hack our English. 
 DOCTOR CAIUS  I pray you, let-a me speak a word with your ear. 
 Vherefore vill you not meet-a me? 
 SIR HUGH EVANS  [Aside to DOCTOR CAIUS]  Pray you, use your patience: 
 in good time. 
 DOCTOR CAIUS  By gar, you are de coward, de Jack dog, John ape. 
 SIR HUGH EVANS  [Aside to DOCTOR CAIUS]  Pray you let us not be 
 laughing-stocks to other men's humours; I desire you 
 in friendship, and I will one way or other make you amends. 

 Aloud  I will knog your urinals about your knave's cockscomb 
 for missing your meetings and appointments. 
 DOCTOR CAIUS  Diable! Jack Rugby,--mine host de Jarteer,--have I 
 not stay for him to kill him? have I not, at de place 
 I did appoint? 
 SIR HUGH EVANS  As I am a Christians soul now, look you, this is the 
 place appointed: I'll be judgement by mine host of 
 the Garter. 
 Host  Peace, I say, Gallia and Gaul, French and Welsh, 
 soul-curer and body-curer! 
 DOCTOR CAIUS  Ay, dat is very good; excellent. 
 Host  Peace, I say! hear mine host of the Garter. Am I 
 politic? am I subtle? am I a Machiavel? Shall I 
 lose my doctor? no; he gives me the potions and the 
 motions. Shall I lose my parson, my priest, my Sir 
 Hugh? no; he gives me the proverbs and the 
 no-verbs. Give me thy hand, terrestrial; so. Give me 
 thy hand, celestial; so. Boys of art, I have 
 deceived you both; I have directed you to wrong 
 places: your hearts are mighty, your skins are 
 whole, and let burnt sack be the issue. Come, lay 
 their swords to pawn. Follow me, lads of peace; 
 follow, follow, follow. 
 SHALLOW  Trust me, a mad host. Follow, gentlemen, follow. 
 SLENDER  [Aside]  O sweet Anne Page! 

 Exeunt SHALLOW, SLENDER, PAGE, and Host  DOCTOR CAIUS  Ha, do I perceive dat? have you make-a de sot of 
 us, ha, ha? 
 SIR HUGH EVANS  This is well; he has made us his vlouting-stog. I 
 desire you that we may be friends; and let us knog 
 our prains together to be revenge on this same 
 scall, scurvy cogging companion, the host of the Garter. 
 DOCTOR CAIUS  By gar, with all my heart. He promise to bring me 
 where is Anne Page; by gar, he deceive me too. 
 SIR HUGH EVANS  Well, I will smite his noddles. Pray you, follow.
