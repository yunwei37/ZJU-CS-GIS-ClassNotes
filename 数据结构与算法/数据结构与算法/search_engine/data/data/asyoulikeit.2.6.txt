 Enter ORLANDO and ADAM  ADAM  Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food! 
 Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell, 
 kind master. 
 ORLANDO  Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live 
 a little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little. 
 If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I 
 will either be food for it or bring it for food to 
 thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers. 
 For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at 
 the arm's end: I will here be with thee presently; 
 and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will 
 give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I 
 come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said! 
 thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly. 
 Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear 
 thee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die for 
 lack of a dinner, if there live any thing in this 
 desert. Cheerly, good Adam!
