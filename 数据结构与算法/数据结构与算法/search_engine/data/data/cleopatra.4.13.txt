 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE XIII. Alexandria. Cleopatra's palace. 
 Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN  CLEOPATRA  Help me, my women! O, he is more mad 
 Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly 
 Was never so emboss'd. 
 CHARMIAN  To the monument! 
 There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead. 
 The soul and body rive not more in parting 
 Than greatness going off. 
 CLEOPATRA  To the monument! 
 Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself; 
 Say, that the last I spoke was 'Antony,' 
 And word it, prithee, piteously: hence, Mardian, 
 And bring me how he takes my death. 
 To the monument!
