 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE II. Field of battle between the British and Roman camps. 
 Enter, from one side, LUCIUS, IACHIMO, and  the Roman Army: from the other side, the  British Army; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS following,  like a poor soldier. They march over and go  out. Then enter again, in skirmish, IACHIMO  and POSTHUMUS LEONATUS he vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO, and then leaves him  IACHIMO  The heaviness and guilt within my bosom 
 Takes off my manhood: I have belied a lady, 
 The princess of this country, and the air on't 
 Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl, 
 A very drudge of nature's, have subdued me 
 In my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borne 
 As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn. 
 If that thy gentry, Britain, go before 
 This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds 
 Is that we scarce are men and you are gods. 

 Exit 
 The battle continues; the Britons fly; CYMBELINE is  taken: then enter, to his rescue, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS  BELARIUS  Stand, stand! We have the advantage of the ground; 
 The lane is guarded: nothing routs us but 
 The villany of our fears. 
 GUIDERIUS  ARVIRAGUS  Stand, stand, and fight! 

 Re-enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and seconds the  Britons: they rescue CYMBELINE, and exeunt. Then re-enter LUCIUS, and IACHIMO, with IMOGEN  CAIUS LUCIUS  Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself; 
 For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such 
 As war were hoodwink'd. 
 IACHIMO  'Tis their fresh supplies. 
 CAIUS LUCIUS  It is a day turn'd strangely: or betimes 
 Let's reinforce, or fly.
