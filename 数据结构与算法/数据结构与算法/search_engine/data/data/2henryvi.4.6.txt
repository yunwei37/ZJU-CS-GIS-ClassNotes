 Enter CADE and the rest, and strikes his staff on London-stone  CADE  Now is Mortimer lord of this city. And here, sitting 
 upon London-stone, I charge and command that, of the 
 city's cost, the pissing-conduit run nothing but 
 claret wine this first year of our reign. And now 
 henceforward it shall be treason for any that calls 
 me other than Lord Mortimer. 

 Enter a Soldier, running  Soldier  Jack Cade! Jack Cade! 
 CADE  Knock him down there. 

 They kill him  SMITH  If this fellow be wise, he'll never call ye Jack 
 Cade more: I think he hath a very fair warning. 
 DICK  My lord, there's an army gathered together in 
 Smithfield. 
 CADE  Come, then, let's go fight with them; but first, go 
 and set London bridge on fire; and, if you can, burn 
 down the Tower too. Come, let's away.
