PROLOGUE The Life of King Henry the Fifth  Shakespeare homepage  |  Henry V  | Act 1, Prologue 
 Next scene  PROLOGUE 
 Enter Chorus  Chorus  O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend 
 The brightest heaven of invention, 
 A kingdom for a stage, princes to act 
 And monarchs to behold the swelling scene! 
 Then should the warlike Harry, like himself, 
 Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels, 
 Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire 
 Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all, 
 The flat unraised spirits that have dared 
 On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth 
 So great an object: can this cockpit hold 
 The vasty fields of France? or may we cram 
 Within this wooden O the very casques 
 That did affright the air at Agincourt? 
 O, pardon! since a crooked figure may 
 Attest in little place a million; 
 And let us, ciphers to this great accompt, 
 On your imaginary forces work. 
 Suppose within the girdle of these walls 
 Are now confined two mighty monarchies, 
 Whose high upreared and abutting fronts 
 The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder: 
 Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts; 
 Into a thousand parts divide on man, 
 And make imaginary puissance; 
 Think when we talk of horses, that you see them 
 Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth; 
 For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings, 
 Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times, 
 Turning the accomplishment of many years 
 Into an hour-glass: for the which supply, 
 Admit me Chorus to this history; 
 Who prologue-like your humble patience pray, 
 Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.
