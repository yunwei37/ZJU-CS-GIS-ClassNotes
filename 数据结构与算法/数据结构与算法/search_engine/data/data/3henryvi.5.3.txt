 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE III. Another part of the field. 
 Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV in triumph; with	GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and the rest 
 KING EDWARD IV  Thus  far  our fortune keeps an upward course, 
 And  we are graced with wreaths of victory. 
 But, in the midst of this bright-shining day, 
 I  spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud, 
 That  will encounter with our glorious sun, 
 Ere  he attain his easeful western bed: 
 I  mean  , my lords, those powers that the queen 
 Hath  raised in Gallia have arrived our  coast 
 And, as we hear, march on to fight with us. 


 CLARENCE  A  little  gale will soon disperse that cloud 
 And  blow  it to the source from whence it came: 
 The  very beams will  dry  those vapours up, 
 For  every cloud engenders not a storm. 


 GLOUCESTER  The  queen is valued thirty thousand strong, 
 And  Somerset, with Oxford fled to her: 
 If  she have time to  breathe  be well  assured 
 Her  faction will be  full  as strong as ours. 


 KING EDWARD IV  We  are advertised by our loving friends 
 That  they do hold their course  toward  Tewksbury: 
 We,  having  now the best at Barnet field, 
 Will  thither  straight  , for willingness rids way; 
 And, as we march, our strength will be augmented 
 In  every  county  as we go along. 
 Strike  up the drum;  cry  'Courage!' and away.
