 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE II. A room in the palace. 
 Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords  DUKE FREDERICK  Can it be possible that no man saw them? 
 It cannot be: some villains of my court 
 Are of consent and sufferance in this. 
 First Lord  I cannot hear of any that did see her. 
 The ladies, her attendants of her chamber, 
 Saw her abed, and in the morning early 
 They found the bed untreasured of their mistress. 
 Second Lord  My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft 
 Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing. 
 Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman, 
 Confesses that she secretly o'erheard 
 Your daughter and her cousin much commend 
 The parts and graces of the wrestler 
 That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles; 
 And she believes, wherever they are gone, 
 That youth is surely in their company. 
 DUKE FREDERICK  Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither; 
 If he be absent, bring his brother to me; 
 I'll make him find him: do this suddenly, 
 And let not search and inquisition quail 
 To bring again these foolish runaways.
