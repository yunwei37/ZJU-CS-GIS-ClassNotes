 Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER  PAGE  Come, come; we'll couch i' the castle-ditch till we 
 see the light of our fairies. Remember, son Slender, 
 my daughter. 
 SLENDER  Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her and we have a 
 nay-word how to know one another: I come to her in 
 white, and cry 'mum;' she cries 'budget;' and by 
 that we know one another. 
 SHALLOW  That's good too: but what needs either your 'mum' 
 or her 'budget?' the white will decipher her well 
 enough. It hath struck ten o'clock. 
 PAGE  The night is dark; light and spirits will become it 
 well. Heaven prosper our sport! No man means evil 
 but the devil, and we shall know him by his horns. 
 Let's away; follow me.
