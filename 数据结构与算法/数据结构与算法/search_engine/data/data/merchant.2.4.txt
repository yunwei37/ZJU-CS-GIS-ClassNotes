 Enter GRATIANO, LORENZO, SALARINO, and SALANIO  LORENZO  Nay, we will slink away in supper-time, 
 Disguise us at my lodging and return, 
 All in an hour. 
 GRATIANO  We have not made good preparation. 
 SALARINO  We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers. 
 SALANIO  'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd, 
 And better in my mind not undertook. 
 LORENZO  'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours 
 To furnish us. 

 Enter LAUNCELOT, with a letter  Friend Launcelot, what's the news? 
 LAUNCELOT  An it shall please you to break up 
 this, it shall seem to signify. 
 LORENZO  I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand; 
 And whiter than the paper it writ on 
 Is the fair hand that writ. 
 GRATIANO  Love-news, in faith. 
 LAUNCELOT  By your leave, sir. 
 LORENZO  Whither goest thou? 
 LAUNCELOT  Marry, sir, to bid my old master the 
 Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian. 
 LORENZO  Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica 
 I will not fail her; speak it privately. 
 Go, gentlemen, 

 Exit Launcelot  Will you prepare you for this masque tonight? 
 I am provided of a torch-bearer. 
 SALANIO  Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight. 
 SALANIO  And so will I. 
 LORENZO  Meet me and Gratiano 
 At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence. 
 SALARINO  'Tis good we do so. 

 Exeunt SALARINO and SALANIO  GRATIANO  Was not that letter from fair Jessica? 
 LORENZO  I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed 
 How I shall take her from her father's house, 
 What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with, 
 What page's suit she hath in readiness. 
 If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven, 
 It will be for his gentle daughter's sake: 
 And never dare misfortune cross her foot, 
 Unless she do it under this excuse, 
 That she is issue to a faithless Jew. 
 Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest: 
 Fair Jessica shall be my torch-beare r.
