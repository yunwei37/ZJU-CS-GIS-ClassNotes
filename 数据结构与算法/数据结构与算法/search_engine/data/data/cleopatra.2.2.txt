 Previous scene  |  Next scene  SCENE II. Rome. The house of LEPIDUS. 
 Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS  LEPIDUS  Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed, 
 And shall become you well, to entreat your captain 
 To soft and gentle speech. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  I shall entreat him 
 To answer like himself: if Caesar move him, 
 Let Antony look over Caesar's head 
 And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter, 
 Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard, 
 I would not shave't to-day. 
 LEPIDUS  'Tis not a time 
 For private stomaching. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  Every time 
 Serves for the matter that is then born in't. 
 LEPIDUS  But small to greater matters must give way. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  Not if the small come first. 
 LEPIDUS  Your speech is passion: 
 But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes 
 The noble Antony. 

 Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS  DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  And yonder, Caesar. 

 Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA  MARK ANTONY  If we compose well here, to Parthia: 
 Hark, Ventidius. 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  I do not know, 
 Mecaenas; ask Agrippa. 
 LEPIDUS  Noble friends, 
 That which combined us was most great, and let not 
 A leaner action rend us. What's amiss, 
 May it be gently heard: when we debate 
 Our trivial difference loud, we do commit 
 Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners, 
 The rather, for I earnestly beseech, 
 Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms, 
 Nor curstness grow to the matter. 
 MARK ANTONY  'Tis spoken well. 
 Were we before our armies, and to fight. 
 I should do thus. 

 Flourish  OCTAVIUS CAESAR  Welcome to Rome. 
 MARK ANTONY  Thank you. 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  Sit. 
 MARK ANTONY  Sit, sir. 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  Nay, then. 
 MARK ANTONY  I learn, you take things ill which are not so, 
 Or being, concern you not. 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  I must be laugh'd at, 
 If, or for nothing or a little, I 
 Should say myself offended, and with you 
 Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I should 
 Once name you derogately, when to sound your name 
 It not concern'd me. 
 MARK ANTONY  My being in Egypt, Caesar, 
 What was't to you? 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  No more than my residing here at Rome 
 Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there 
 Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt 
 Might be my question. 
 MARK ANTONY  How intend you, practised? 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  You may be pleased to catch at mine intent 
 By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother 
 Made wars upon me; and their contestation 
 Was theme for you, you were the word of war. 
 MARK ANTONY  You do mistake your business; my brother never 
 Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it; 
 And have my learning from some true reports, 
 That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather 
 Discredit my authority with yours; 
 And make the wars alike against my stomach, 
 Having alike your cause? Of this my letters 
 Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel, 
 As matter whole you have not to make it with, 
 It must not be with this. 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  You praise yourself 
 By laying defects of judgment to me; but 
 You patch'd up your excuses. 
 MARK ANTONY  Not so, not so; 
 I know you could not lack, I am certain on't, 
 Very necessity of this thought, that I, 
 Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought, 
 Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars 
 Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife, 
 I would you had her spirit in such another: 
 The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle 
 You may pace easy, but not such a wife. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  Would we had all such wives, that the men might go 
 to wars with the women! 
 MARK ANTONY  So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar 
 Made out of her impatience, which not wanted 
 Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant 
 Did you too much disquiet: for that you must 
 But say, I could not help it. 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  I wrote to you 
 When rioting in Alexandria; you 
 Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts 
 Did gibe my missive out of audience. 
 MARK ANTONY  Sir, 
 He fell upon me ere admitted: then 
 Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want 
 Of what I was i' the morning: but next day 
 I told him of myself; which was as much 
 As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow 
 Be nothing of our strife; if we contend, 
 Out of our question wipe him. 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  You have broken 
 The article of your oath; which you shall never 
 Have tongue to charge me with. 
 LEPIDUS  Soft, Caesar! 
 MARK ANTONY  No, 
 Lepidus, let him speak: 
 The honour is sacred which he talks on now, 
 Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar; 
 The article of my oath. 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  To lend me arms and aid when I required them; 
 The which you both denied. 
 MARK ANTONY  Neglected, rather; 
 And then when poison'd hours had bound me up 
 From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may, 
 I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty 
 Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power 
 Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia, 
 To have me out of Egypt, made wars here; 
 For which myself, the ignorant motive, do 
 So far ask pardon as befits mine honour 
 To stoop in such a case. 
 LEPIDUS  'Tis noble spoken. 
 MECAENAS  If it might please you, to enforce no further 
 The griefs between ye: to forget them quite 
 Were to remember that the present need 
 Speaks to atone you. 
 LEPIDUS  Worthily spoken, Mecaenas. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  Or, if you borrow one another's love for the 
 instant, you may, when you hear no more words of 
 Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to 
 wrangle in when you have nothing else to do. 
 MARK ANTONY  Thou art a soldier only: speak no more. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  That truth should be silent I had almost forgot. 
 MARK ANTONY  You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  Go to, then; your considerate stone. 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  I do not much dislike the matter, but 
 The manner of his speech; for't cannot be 
 We shall remain in friendship, our conditions 
 So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew 
 What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge 
 O' the world I would pursue it. 
 AGRIPPA  Give me leave, Caesar,-- 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  Speak, Agrippa. 
 AGRIPPA  Thou hast a sister by the mother's side, 
 Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony 
 Is now a widower. 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  Say not so, Agrippa: 
 If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof 
 Were well deserved of rashness. 
 MARK ANTONY  I am not married, Caesar: let me hear 
 Agrippa further speak. 
 AGRIPPA  To hold you in perpetual amity, 
 To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts 
 With an unslipping  knot, take Antony 
 Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims 
 No worse a husband than the best of men; 
 Whose virtue and whose general graces speak 
 That which none else can utter. By this marriage, 
 All little jealousies, which now seem great, 
 And all great fears, which now import their dangers, 
 Would then be nothing: truths would be tales, 
 Where now half tales be truths: her love to both 
 Would, each to other and all loves to both, 
 Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke; 
 For 'tis a studied, not a present thought, 
 By duty ruminated. 
 MARK ANTONY  Will Caesar speak? 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd 
 With what is spoke already. 
 MARK ANTONY  What power is in Agrippa, 
 If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,' 
 To make this good? 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  The power of Caesar, and 
 His power unto Octavia. 
 MARK ANTONY  May I never 
 To this good purpose, that so fairly shows, 
 Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand: 
 Further this act of grace: and from this hour 
 The heart of brothers govern in our loves 
 And sway our great designs! 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  There is my hand. 
 A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother 
 Did ever love so dearly: let her live 
 To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never 
 Fly off our loves again! 
 LEPIDUS  Happily, amen! 
 MARK ANTONY  I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey; 
 For he hath laid strange courtesies and great 
 Of late upon me: I must thank him only, 
 Lest my remembrance suffer ill report; 
 At heel of that, defy him. 
 LEPIDUS  Time calls upon's: 
 Of us must Pompey presently be sought, 
 Or else he seeks out us. 
 MARK ANTONY  Where lies he? 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  About the mount Misenum. 
 MARK ANTONY  What is his strength by land? 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  Great and increasing: but by sea 
 He is an absolute master. 
 MARK ANTONY  So is the fame. 
 Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it: 
 Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we 
 The business we have talk'd of. 
 OCTAVIUS CAESAR  With most gladness: 
 And do invite you to my sister's view, 
 Whither straight I'll lead you. 
 MARK ANTONY  Let us, Lepidus, 
 Not lack your company. 
 LEPIDUS  Noble Antony, 
 Not sickness should detain me. 

 Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, and LEPIDUS  MECAENAS  Welcome from Egypt, sir. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My 
 honourable friend, Agrippa! 
 AGRIPPA  Good Enobarbus! 
 MECAENAS  We have cause to be glad that matters are so well 
 digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and 
 made the night light with drinking. 
 MECAENAS  Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and 
 but twelve persons there; is this true? 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more 
 monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting. 
 MECAENAS  She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to 
 her. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up 
 his heart, upon the river of Cydnus. 
 AGRIPPA  There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised 
 well for her. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  I will tell you. 
 The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne, 
 Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold; 
 Purple the sails, and so perfumed that 
 The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver, 
 Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made 
 The water which they beat to follow faster, 
 As amorous of their strokes. For her own person, 
 It beggar'd all description: she did lie 
 In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue-- 
 O'er-picturing that Venus where we see 
 The fancy outwork nature: on each side her 
 Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids, 
 With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem 
 To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool, 
 And what they undid did. 
 AGRIPPA  O, rare for Antony! 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides, 
 So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes, 
 And made their bends adornings: at the helm 
 A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle 
 Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands, 
 That yarely frame the office. From the barge 
 A strange invisible perfume hits the sense 
 Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast 
 Her people out upon her; and Antony, 
 Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone, 
 Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy, 
 Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too, 
 And made a gap in nature. 
 AGRIPPA  Rare Egyptian! 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  Upon her landing, Antony sent to her, 
 Invited her to supper: she replied, 
 It should be better he became her guest; 
 Which she entreated: our courteous Antony, 
 Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak, 
 Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast, 
 And for his ordinary pays his heart 
 For what his eyes eat only. 
 AGRIPPA  Royal wench! 
 She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed: 
 He plough'd her, and she cropp'd. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  I saw her once 
 Hop forty paces through the public street; 
 And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted, 
 That she did make defect perfection, 
 And, breathless, power breathe forth. 
 MECAENAS  Now Antony must leave her utterly. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  Never; he will not: 
 Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale 
 Her infinite variety: other women cloy 
 The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry 
 Where most she satisfies; for vilest things 
 Become themselves in her: that the holy priests 
 Bless her when she is riggish. 
 MECAENAS  If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle 
 The heart of Antony, Octavia is 
 A blessed lottery to him. 
 AGRIPPA  Let us go. 
 Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest 
 Whilst you abide here. 
 DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS  Humbly, sir, I thank you.
